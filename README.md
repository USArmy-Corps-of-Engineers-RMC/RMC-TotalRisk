# RMC-TotalRisk
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers TotalRisk software (RMC-TotalRisk) performs quantitative risk calculations for a system from a set of hazard, transform, system response, and consequence functions. RMC-TotalRisk is part of an integrated software suite that supports risk assessments. The software features a fully integrated modeling platform, including a modern graphical user interface, data entry, report quality charts, and diagnostic tools. RMC-TotalRisk can evaluate risk for a single component with multiple failure modes and a complex system comprised of multiple components.

RMC-TotalRisk is a powerful risk analysis software designed with an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. It simplifies the complexity of risk assessments by connecting the core components of risk — hazard, transform, response, and consequences — through a clear and intuitive risk diagram. The software generates a comprehensive range of risk outputs, including excess, background, total, failure, and non-failure risks. Each component of the analysis can incorporate uncertainty, and the software supports modeling multiple locations with distinct failure modes as separate system components, streamlining system-level risk evaluations.

## Development

Version 1.1 is in active development on the [`v1.1-development`](../../tree/v1.1-development) branch. The effort rebuilds RMC-TotalRisk around a headless .NET 10 model library (`RMC.TotalRisk.dll`) — the Monte Carlo risk engine and all input functions with no UI dependencies — followed by new UI and application layers. The v1.0 release above remains the supported product in the meantime.

Repository structure on the development branch:

```
RMC-TotalRisk.sln        ← solution (Core / Tests / Verification)
src/                     ← RMC.TotalRisk (model library), RMC.TotalRisk.Tests, RMC.TotalRisk.Verification
docs/                    ← phased roadmap, progress log, normative specs, verification strategy
examples/                ← example projects
scripts/                 ← quality-gate scripts
```

Build and test (requires the .NET 10 SDK and a sibling checkout of [Numerics](https://github.com/USACE-RMC/Numerics) at `C:\GIT\numerics`, built for `net10.0`):

```bash
dotnet build             # zero warnings expected
dotnet test -c Release   # fast unit-test gate (verification suite runs separately)
```

Development documentation starts at [docs/index.md](docs/index.md); the phased plan is [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).
