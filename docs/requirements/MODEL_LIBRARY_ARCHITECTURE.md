# RMC.TotalRisk Model Library Architecture

> Living architectural specification for `RMC.TotalRisk.dll` — the headless .NET 10 compute library at the heart of the v1.1.0 modernization. **Authoritative home (since 2026-07-20): `docs/requirements/` in the RMC-TotalRisk repo**; the phased plan implementing this spec is [../ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md). The copy at the `C:\GIT\RMC-TotalRisk-Dev` root is frozen with a pointer here, and legacy porting-source paths referenced below (e.g., `RMC-TotalRisk/RMC.TotalRisk.IO/...`) live in that Dev repo. The locked sections are the contract every cluster-port PR references.

**Status**: 2026-07-31 — **v0.23** (Phase 10B complete). The exact static fault-tree response now
meets every applicable definition-of-done gate in the normative tree-response design: the
single-parent authored tree with shared-logical/independent transfers, the exact ROBDD evaluator
with its loud runtime budget, Rauzy cut-set inspection with the non-coherence rule, three-kind
probability sources at arbitrary acyclic nesting, unified-variable LHS, two-mode persistence with
read-side embedded-target unification, projected `SharedVariable`-ordinal identity, the fixed-seed
fault property corpus, the tree node-importance analysis for both kinds, the 17-test greenfield
verification family, >90% fast coverage, and hash-gated F7 performance. The full tree-response
design is implemented.

Prior status — 2026-07-28 — **v0.22** (Phase 10A complete). The common/event-tree foundation
meets every applicable definition-of-done gate in the normative tree-response design: controlled
authoring/references, recursive LHS, two-mode persistence, projected identity, expanded stable
ports, immutable compiled evaluation, fixed-seed property/routing/LHS/thread evidence, >90% fast
coverage, and hash-gated F5 performance. Phase 10B exact static fault trees are unblocked, not begun.

Prior status — 2026-07-28 — **v0.21** (Phases 10A/10B design ratification). [EVENT_AND_FAULT_TREE_RESPONSE_DESIGN.md](EVENT_AND_FAULT_TREE_RESPONSE_DESIGN.md) is the normative specialization for tree response functions. It resolves Q-B and Q-O: event and fault trees create conditional fragility only; event links are independent compiled clones; fault links explicitly distinguish shared logical events from independent clones; both gain controlled authoring/graph algorithms, recursive LHS, two-mode references, and projected identity; static fault probability uses an exact ROBDD. Secondary-hazard event nodes are excluded, while `WeightedHazardLevel` remains active bivariate-response scope. Phase 10 is split into 10A common/event foundation and 10B fault trees.

Prior status — 2026-07-27 — **v0.20** (Phase 8.6 safety gate). Failure-mode exclusive
enumeration is lazy for every dependency, so the engine no longer allocates a dense
`U × (2^U−1)` matrix. The established independent, perfectly-positive, and PCM algorithms retain
their order, formulas, convergence predicates, correlations, and `1E-4` defaults. TotalRisk applies
only the approved deterministic remaining-budget clip to emitted exclusive cells before every
downstream consumer; it never proportionally normalizes. The 50-dimensional joint VEGAS limit
remains an explicit integration limit, not a failure-mode storage limit. The 1D AGK domain is the
natural sampled-hazard support plus explicit lower and upper endpoint rectangles, yielding an
exactly exhaustive ledger without stretching interior bins.

Prior status — 2026-07-25 — **v0.19** (Phase 9 partial landing: composite hazard, transform, and response. **Q-Y ADDED AND RESOLVED** — composite mixtures are aleatory only; see §11 Q-Y, the amended §5.5.3 hash rows for the three composites, the corrected §5.8.4 dimension rows (both were pre-Q-V), and the practitioner doctrine in `docs/technical-reference/composite-functions.md`.)

Prior status — 2026-07-24 — **v0.18** (Phase 6.7 landing; supersedes conflicting text below wherever it appears). **Q-X CLOSES** — the cascading-response-end-states design (v0.16 item 4) is implemented, with the §7.9 Stage-0 ratifications (three user decisions 2026-07-24: final-polarity classification, flipped-final-sibling excess pairing, single-claiming-group scope; plus the Q2 duplicate-leaf ruling — allow with legacy flat combination and advisory warnings) and these landing records:

1. **The one deliberate hash event.** `ResponseStage` serializes `BranchPolarity` resolved-on-write (the `ConsequenceHazardPosition` precedent; pre-6.7 payloads load forward as Fail), and the component identity form annotates each projected mode with its `ResponseNodes` occurrence-ordinal topology — **identity-form only, never persisted** (the third instance of the v0.9 identity-form precedent). The annotation closes a real gap: one shared response element (an exclusive branch pair with one knowledge draw) and two equal-content duplicate elements (independent events and draws) previously hashed identically while computing differently. Every component hash and seed moved once; the deterministic bit-pin (`Test_Deterministic_BitPin_CascadePhases`), the relational reproducibility families, and the perf byte gates carried the proof that only seeds moved (F1/F2/F3 reproduced the post-event hashes bit-exactly through the whole engine rework, then re-pinned once for the Q3 labels — a JSON-only movement).
2. **The engine acceptance.** Both Q-X seams are gone: `SampledFailureMode` captures every stage (flattened transform slices, per-stage fragilities and polarities) and `SRP(h)` is the polarity product ∏ᵢ (πᵢ = Fail ? pᵢ : 1 − pᵢ) at per-stage transformed signals; `ConsequenceInput` folds the full multi-stage chain (fixing the stage-0 truncation); `InverseSRP` stays exact for single-stage Fail modes and throws for cascades (a polarity product has no monotone inverse; no engine consumer). The combination kernels operate over `EndStateGroupLayout`'s **combination units** (exclusive state groups + standalone states; the caches/MVN/correlation dimension is the unit count): unit masses are exact member sums, adjusted masses distribute back conditionally, the joint odometer crosses per-unit concatenated (state, branch) entries, and the Shapley split lands on picked states with exact Σ-identities. Claimed non-failure states ride the complement-conditional mixture (one distribution driving the non-failure scalar, the joint excess baseline, and the Background/NonFail/Total recording — exhaustive Total preserved); mode-scope claimed recording lands in the state's own NonFail stream. Validation: one claiming group per component (§7.9.5), the narrow competing gate (§7.9.6 — else-chain failure states only; progression cascades compete fine), group-aware guardrails (within-unit ADD, across-unit MULTIPLY), and the §7.9.1 branch-claim advisories (cascade-active graphs only — every pre-6.7 shape validates silently).
3. **The knowledge-sampling contract (user directive 2026-07-24).** Knowledge uncertainty samples independently across all functions — cascade stage responses included — with exactly two deliberate constructs: the Q-N consequence pairing (which the §7.9.4 sibling resolution rides unchanged) and the one-instance-one-quantity rule for a shared response element whose sibling branches must partition on one sampled curve. Pinned in `Test_MultiStage_ResponseKnowledge_IndependentPerStage`.
4. **Q3 labels.** `FailureModeRealization`/`FailureModeResults` carry the stamped end-state `Name` (terminal-first label chain) and the append-only `PathLabel` branch descriptor on realization, summary, and percentile-band trees.
5. **Evidence.** `CascadeEndStateVerification` (8 tests, isolated): the partial-damage cascade vs its natural MC oracle (natural simulation is exact for the conditional complement under independence), the joint/ME/competing across-unit matrix (convention oracles for the latter two), the bit-exact saturated-stage single-stage equivalence, reliability-mode APF, system smokes, and the port/polarity reproducibility pins — [../verification/cascade-end-states.md](../verification/cascade-end-states.md); math in [../technical-reference/cascading-end-states.md](../technical-reference/cascading-end-states.md). Deferred, documented: multi-group claimed states (cross-product complement), competing over else-chains (telescoping-union analysis), state-level cross-group `ExclusivePCM` coupling (the copula couples unit failure indicators only), numeric `InverseSRP`.

Prior status — 2026-07-24 — **v0.17** (Phase 6.6 landing; supersedes conflicting text below wherever it appears). The measures/diagnostics/sensitivity closures:

1. **Q-T RESOLVED — the profile hazard selector.** Shape: an element reference on the component — `SystemComponent.ProfileHazardElementId` (`Guid?`, null = the driving hazard axis; `SetProfileHazardElement` convenience), valid only for a `TransformElement` in the component's own graph on an unbroken upstream path from the hazard element. Resolved once at the `SetupSamplers` freeze into a runtime-only transform chain that each realization samples, so every recorded hazard coordinate — component profiles and extents, `HazardThresholdProbability`, and the mode-scope recorded-hazard pass-down — lands on the selected axis of *that realization's* sampled chain. **Seed-inert by ratified decision**: serialized append-only but excluded from the identity-form hash, because the axis is presentation, not compute — flipping it must never re-roll Monte Carlo draws. The asymmetry with the already-hashed `HazardThreshold` is deliberate (the threshold is a measure input; with a profile selected it is interpreted on the profile axis, with a validation advisory naming the axis). The System Response Probability profile plots against **hazard exceedance probability**, not a hazard axis — a hazard-axis SRP is ill-posed when failure modes respond to different transformed signals; AEP is the normalized universal scale, independent of the profile selection (user decision 2026-07-24).
2. **The risk-profile catalog + five-stream banding parity.** Three new append-only `Curve` arrays, each one ascending accumulation pass over the already-recorded points: `CumulativeFailureProbabilities` (terminal ordinate ≡ the Fail stream's `MassBalance` — the practitioners' traditional ascending cumulative plot, named honestly: it is the un-normalized CDF of the failure-causing hazard, NOT "APF vs hazard"), `CumulativeExpectedConsequences` (terminal ≡ the stream `Mean`, per consequence type), and `SystemResponseProbabilities` against its own AEP axis; self-normalizing companion views are `[JsonIgnore]` derived, not stored. The v1.1 Total-only percentile banding was a **parity bug** — v1.0 banded all five streams; restored and extended to the new arrays (banded like the existing profiles; ratified).
3. **% contribution to risk (new diagnostic).** Within each exclusive failure event (all four combination methods produce an exclusive decomposition summing to the union at every hazard level): probability split **equally** among participants — exactly the Shapley value of the union game v(S) = P(∪Fⱼ) — and risk split **proportional to marginal consequences** (user-ratified for Joint Max/Min; ME/CCA/Competing reduce to the adjusted-marginal scheme other tools use). Stored as raw per-type values (`RiskContribution { FailureProbability, FailureMean, ExcessMean }`) on the realization and summary trees at FM→component and component→system scope; **shares derive on read with two first-class bases** — % of APF (consequence-free, so reliability mode reports it fully) and % of mean loss. Σ-identities are exact: FM sums ≡ component `MassBalance`/`Mean` to ~1e-12 (the same raw recorded mass published as `TotalProbability`); the additive system's union APF splits by the exact O(D²) Poisson-binomial DP φᵢ = pᵢ·E[1/(1+Kᵢ)] (no 2^D enumeration); the joint system accumulates per-component attributions inside the VEGAS integrand under the same self-normalization. Full math: [../technical-reference/risk-contribution.md](../technical-reference/risk-contribution.md).
4. **Scalar CIs + convergence diagnostics.** `EnsembleResults.Summary` (`EnsembleSummary`: Mean/Median/Lower/Upper as four `SystemRiskResults` trees) reduces every scalar measure — the 10 `SummaryRiskResults` scalars, the contribution fields, and the integrator telemetry — measure-wise across the stored ensemble (sequential means; percentile-consistent per measure, deliberately NOT one coherent realization: percentile-of-VaR ≠ VaR-of-percentile-curve is the point), recomputable on any loaded ensemble via `ComputeSummary`. `ConvergenceDiagnostics` carries integrator aggregates and per-headline ensemble standard errors (SD/√N) — numbers only; a headless library sets no pass/fail policy.
5. **The unified sensitivity engine (ratified scope amendment).** No legacy Dictionary-shaped `Sensitivity()` clone and no public `RiskAtHazardLevel` port: one typed engine — `MeasureSensitivity`/`MeasureSensitivityMatrix` (outputs = any stored scalar risk measure across the ensemble; zero re-simulation, inputs re-derived bit-exactly from content seeds) and `HazardLevelSensitivity` (outputs = the v1.0 risk-at-a-hazard-level decomposition from a fresh no-record evaluation; profile-axis native — each realization inverts its own sampled profile chain). Inputs are per-function knowledge draws plus per-mode coupling columns, labeled by input function from **one shared walk** (`SystemComponent.CollectSensitivityInputs` mirrors the `SetupSamplers` walk and dedup rule — labels and seeds can never drift); independent by construction, so `SensitivityIndex` = Pearson r² is a true variance share (≡ the TR Appendix G regression main-effect index under orthogonal LHS). Scope model: `componentIndex = -1` = system outputs vs the union of every component's inputs; `≥ 0` = that component's outputs vs its own inputs; `failureModeIndex` narrows outputs only. Results are runtime-only objects (never persisted).
6. **§5.5.8 implemented** — the seed-stable perturbation mode (see the rewritten section): per-walk-ordinal captured/pinned seed maps plus the joint VEGAS seed base, loud shape validation, never serialized; documented residuals (integrand-following refinement; the joint integrand is inherently consequence-bearing; canonical-order flips).
7. **Q-W RESOLVED (design recorded, implementation deliberately withheld).** Per-type marginal results and the per-type `ConsequenceThreshold` (`ConsequenceTypeDescriptor`, append-only, NaN default — the Phase 6.5 primary-only interim closes) ship the practical surface; the shared-exposure declaration is sketched in §6.4.1 and is implemented only when cross-type joint statistics are actually requested.

Prior status — 2026-07-23 — **v0.16** (Phase 6.5 landing; supersedes conflicting text below wherever it appears). The gap-audit closures from the multi-consequence session:

1. **Q-U RESOLVED — the multi-consequence axis computes.** The consequence-type axis is **declared at the analysis level** (user-ratified): the primary type is `RiskAnalysis.SpecifiedConsequence`/`ConsequenceUnit` and every additional position is an immutable `ConsequenceTypeDescriptor` in `RiskAnalysis.AdditionalConsequenceTypes` (append-only serialization; a missing child loads forward as the legacy single-type axis; the descriptor attribute names reuse the audited label strip rules, so the axis can never enter a canonical hash). Validation strictly matches every component's failure and non-failure paths against the declaration in risk mode — counts and order always, labels and units whenever both sides are non-blank (blank is a wildcard) — so consequence types now gate valid system configurations the way hazard types do, and a new advisory warns when components' driving hazards disagree on non-blank axis labels. The engine computes **every** declared type in one pass: position k samples coupling column k (the per-type Q-N pairing the matrix has carried since Phase 3), the probability structure — SRPs, pathway decomposition, combination adjustments, failure unions — is computed once and shared across types, adaptive refinement is driven by the primary type with secondaries riding the same hazard nodes (probe and warm-up evaluations stay single-type), and results land in per-type containers at every scope: `AdditionalCurves[k − 1]` with per-type consequence extents and per-type percentile grids on the realization trees, `AdditionalConsequences` on the summary tree, and the declared labels echoed on `SystemRealization`/`SystemRiskResults`. The secondary consequence-threshold (assurance) measure is NaN — the analysis threshold is declared in the primary type's units; per-type thresholds land with the risk-measures phase (Phase 6.6). The closure is RNG-silent for a fixed model (consequence functions are outside the seeded sampler walk), so the full pinned verification suite passed **unchanged**, and the new `MultiConsequenceVerification` family (two-type MC oracle, single-type bit-identity pin, dedicated-primary quadrature parity, cross-model ensemble parity, additive/joint system identities) is the executable evidence ([../verification/multi-consequence.md](../verification/multi-consequence.md)).
2. **§6.4.1 erratum (the Q-W guardrail bound):** the engine computes per-type **marginal** results and never crosses exposure branches across consequence types — the cross-type product the v0.13 interim text described does not exist in the compute. The mode-level branch guardrail is therefore the **sum** of exposure branches across the mode's consequence positions (thresholds 64/1024 unchanged), and the component- and system-level guardrails bound the worst single type. Q-W (a shared exposure draw across types) stays open but is moot for per-type marginal outputs — it matters only if cross-type joint statistics are ever produced.
3. **`Curves.GetCurve(RiskType)`** lands (the `RiskType` enum's first code consumer), and `JointConsequenceType.Minimum` gains explicit switch cases alongside the defensive default arms.
4. **Cascading response end states — the Q-X successor design, RATIFIED** (four user decisions; implementation is roadmap Phase 6.7). **Encoding:** `ResponseElement` grows a second typed output port — port 0 = Fail (the default every existing connection already targets), port 1 = Non-Fail — reusing the `RiskConnection.SourcePort` serialization wholesale. **Semantics:** the risk diagram becomes the event tree — each response is a chance node whose branch probability is hazard-dependent (the fragility p(h) on the Fail port, 1 − p(h) on Non-Fail), transforms between stages remap the signal, every consequence terminal is an **end state** whose weight at h is the product of branch probabilities along its path, and the terminals of one cascade are **mutually exclusive**, summing ≤ 1 with any unwired Non-Fail mass flowing to the component's background path implicitly (the v1.0 auto-`RemainderNode`, generalized) — so a single-response mode behaves exactly as today. **Partial failures with partial damage states** are consequences wired to Non-Fail-port continuations. **Compute mapping:** end states ARE the projected failure modes (one per terminal, each carrying the declared consequence-type axis); `ResponseStage` gains an append-only resolved-on-write `BranchPolarity`, the mode's SRP becomes the polarity product, terminals sharing upstream responses form a mutually-exclusive state group (within-group exact partition; across groups the existing `FailureModeMethod`; remainder = the existing complement math), and shared response instances already share sampled draws, keeping sibling end states coherent for free. **`EventTreeResponse` survives** as the compact single-node authoring convenience for chance-probability trees (Phase 10, reshaped), sharing this end-state contract, with per-leaf output ports completing the dormant v1.0 `MultipleConsequences` scaffold. Phase 6.5 landed the resilience hooks only: per-terminal results scope, the factored SRP seam, reserved attribute space, and the two Q-X rejection seams left intact until 6.7.

Prior status — 2026-07-23 — **v0.15** (Phase 4b/4c landing; supersedes conflicting text below wherever it appears). The implementation ratifications and errata from landing multi-component system risk and reliability mode:

1. **§7.8 additive convolution is an exact lattice, not `EmpiricalDistribution.Convolve`.** At implementation, `Convolve` proved unusable for the zero-inflated construction: it samples continuous `PDF`s on a uniform grid, and a distribution-function jump (the "component did not fail" atom) has no finite density — any ramp-width approximation either loses the atom or corrupts the sampled density and its renormalization, and the per-stage PDF-normalize/regrid chain cannot hold the 1e-6 mean-parity gate. The engine instead bins each component's exact recorded `(mass, consequence)` pairs onto a shared consequence lattice with a **moment-preserving two-node split** plus the zero atom, and convolves the lattice mass vectors by `Fourier.FFT` (the same Numerics primitive `Convolve` uses internally) — the public kernel is **`Analyses/SystemConvolution`**. Mass and first moments are preserved exactly, so the convolved mean equals Σ component means to roundoff *by construction*; higher moments carry an O(step²) quantization bounded by `SystemConvolutionPoints ≥ 4096`. **Numerics item N8 is extended:** the follow-up is an atom-aware (discrete/mixed) convolution alongside the log-spaced grid. The lattice zero node is kept only on exhaustive streams (on defective streams it is the no-event atom, and zero-valued events quantize into it); after convolution the defective system stream probabilities are restored to the **v1.0 system-state semantics** — Fail and Excess carry the independent failure union, NonFail its complement.
2. **§7.8 the automatic γ heuristic is a deterministic quadrature probe, not a warm-up harvest.** Two implementation facts broke the ratified v0.13 mechanism: `Vegas.ConfigureForRareEvents` raises `NumberOfBins`, whose setter reallocates the importance grid — so γ must be configured **before** the warm-up, not after it — and a γ = 1 Monte Carlo warm-up cannot observe the rare failure probabilities `pTarget` needs (that blindness is the very problem the transform solves). The engine instead probes each component's annualized failure probability on the mean sample with adaptive Gauss–Kronrod (`AFP_i = ∫ P_F,i(p) dp` — the one call site where the integral's returned value is the product), once per run, ~10³ evaluations per component, deterministic; `pTarget = clamp(min_i AFP_i · Alpha, 1e-12, 1e-2)` unchanged. The warm-up itself then adapts under the active γ — strictly better than the post-warm-up ordering the v0.13 text assumed.
3. **§7.8 recording passes and mass self-normalization.** The joint path records across **five** VEGAS recording passes (`Initialize = 1`, `IndependentEvaluations = 5`; an engine constant, not an option) with `FinalEvaluations` already D-scaled, and scales every recorded mass by the reciprocal of the realized weight sum — per-pass `Σ wgt` equals the domain volume only in expectation, so self-normalization makes the exhaustive Total budget exactly one (and stays consistent if the evaluation cap truncates a pass). VEGAS is driven with `UseSobolSequence = false` and `MersenneTwister(vegasSeed)`: the current Numerics default is a Sobol sequence, which would make the driving stream seed-independent and void the §5.5 content-seed contract. The §7.3 erratum's seed formula is realized as an iterative fold **in canonical-hash order**: `systemSeed = fold(PRNGSeed; (hash_i, occurrence_i))` over the sorted components, `vegasSeed = ToPositiveSeed(HashCombine(systemSeed, "VEGAS", realizationIndex))`.
4. **§7.8 reproducibility scope of the joint method.** Component **renaming** is bit-inert (nothing keys on names); component **reordering** is statistically equivalent but *not* bit-identical — the VEGAS variates couple the hypercube dimensions, so reordering permutes which coordinate stream drives which component. This is inherent to any joint driving stream (v1.0 had the same property) and is pinned as documented behavior. The additive path is fully bit-inert under reorder + rename: content-based seeds plus the canonical-hash convolution order (item 1) remove the association-rounding sensitivity.
5. **§7.8 combination-width guardrail.** The joint integrand crosses the components' recorded pathway/branch entry lists, so `RiskAnalysis.Validate()` bounds the product of per-component worst-case widths (`SystemComponent.EstimateRecordedFailureEntries`, internal): warning above 4,096 entries per evaluation, error above 65,536 — the system-level analog of the Q-W guardrails. The legacy `tPF` double-increment is not carried forward (the failure union is the Fail stream's recorded mass; no scalar duplicates it), and `Probability.IndependentExclusiveLazy` retains the established convergence shortcut and default tolerances. Its status reports capped enumeration; finite probability outputs are clipped at their consuming boundary without changing the enumeration formula.
6. **§7.7/§4 reliability mode lands (Phase 4c) with a mode-aware validation chain.** `Validate(RiskAnalysisMode)` overloads on `FailureMode`, `ConsequenceElement`, `ComponentGraph`, and `SystemComponent` (the parameterless `Validate()` remains the risk-mode contract): reliability relaxes exactly the consequence-content requirements — consequence elements stay the structural path terminals but need no functions, the positional excess-pairing alignment is skipped, and everything present is still validated. The engine forces the effective refinement objective to `RiskIntegrand.TotalProbabilityOfFailure` in reliability mode (a consequence-free model's consequence objectives are identically zero, which would defeat the adaptivity; the configured option applies to risk mode). **The reliability results shape is the existing containers**, not a parallel tree: the annualized failure probability is the Fail stream's `TotalProbability` at every level — failure mode, component, and system (union under the additive method; the recorded union under the joint method) — with the consequence surface degenerate at zero by construction and the ensemble carrying the AFP distribution for uncertainty. Its Total stream remains exhaustive and obeys the same exact mass invariant as risk mode.

Prior status — 2026-07-22 — **v0.14** (Phase 4 engine-core landing; supersedes conflicting text below wherever it appears). The session ratifications and implementation errata from landing the 1D engine core:

1. **Q-V ratified YES** (§11 → Resolved): mixture-branch exposure enumeration applies in the mean-only AND full-MC paths. The consequence contract carries `SampleExposureBranches()` and `SampleExposureBranches(double percentile)` (the percentile overload samples every branch co-monotonically at one shared knowledge percentile — the same draw Q-N pairs) plus structural `CountExposureBranches()` for the Q-W guardrails. `CompositeConsequence.SamplingDimensions` is 0 in every mode; the standalone per-realization mixture surface (`SampleFunction(int)`, the uncertainty summary) rides an internal selector matrix generated with the identical seed fold and scheme the pre-Q-V dimension used, so pre-existing standalone and verification streams are bit-identical.
2. **Q-N resolved** (§11): the technical reference grounds the v1.0 behavior — the failure/non-failure consequence pair is drawn perfectly correlated within a mode. v1.1 realizes it as an N×max(K,1) coupling matrix on the `FailureMode` (one column per consequence position), seeded content-first: the mode claims its walk's first ordinal for the matrix (`ToPositiveSeed(HashCombine(componentSeed, fm.CanonicalHash(), ordinal))`). **§5.8.7 erratum:** consequence functions are excluded from the `SetupSamplers` walk — they need no percentile matrices; the coupling matrix supplies their shared knowledge percentile.
3. **Multi-stage response composition is implemented.** Cascading response chains use typed Fail/Non-Fail branches and the end-state semantics in section 7.9. Validation accepts supported multi-stage graphs; `InverseSRP` remains intentionally unsupported for cascades because a polarity product has no general monotone inverse.
4. **Q-U interim ratified**: risk math and LECs consume the primary consequence (`ConsequenceFunctions[0]`) only; positions ≥ 1 stay coupled through the coupling-matrix shape but are not evaluated until the multi-axis results design lands. Q-W guardrails still bound the structural cross product.
5. **Q-T deferred**: `ProfileHazardFunction` (profile-axis remap) and the legacy `Sensitivity()` surface move to the risk-diagnostics/sensitivity sessions; profiles (`HazardFrequency`/`HazardvsCEN`) land on the driving hazard axis.
6. **§5.5.3 options recipe extended (append-only)**: `RiskAnalysisOptions` hashes every compute-relevant field — the v1.0 set plus `SamplingScheme`, `Mode`, `RiskIntegrand`, `VegasTailFocusMode`, `VegasTailFocusParameter`, `SystemConvolutionPoints`, and the correlation matrix only under the correlation-matrix dependency (the Q-G precedent). `UseDefaults` is convenience metadata — `"UseDefaults"` joined the `CanonicalizationRules.ModelRules` strip list. The full option surface (including the 4b/4c fields) serializes from Phase 4 so the append-only attribute surface is written once; the options hash never feeds Monte Carlo seeds (only `PRNGSeed` does). **Naming settled:** the enum is `SystemRiskType { AdditiveRiskMethod, JointRiskMethod }` (verbatim v1.0) carried by the options property `SystemRiskMethod`; §4/§7.8's "Additive"/"Joint" prose is shorthand.
7. **§7.3 errata**: there is no per-realization seed array — knowledge sampling is fully covered by the per-function percentile matrices, and only the joint path's VEGAS needs per-realization randomness (Phase 4b: `vegasSeed(idx) = ToPositiveSeed(HashCombine(PRNGSeed, systemContentHash, idx))` over the canonical-sorted component hashes). The sampler walk seeds each **distinct function instance once** (reference identity; first canonical owner wins): a shared instance is one knowledge quantity drawing identical realizations everywhere it appears, while equal-content distinct instances get different ordinals and draw independently (Q-J preserved). The parallel realization loop uses index-owned writes with sequential post-pass reductions (flags, extents, percentile means) — bit-identical at any thread count by construction.
8. **§3/§7.7 additions**: `Results/` gains `RiskComputeFlags` (the per-realization warning flags replacing the legacy `ref bool` quartet) and internal `ResultsJson`; `Analyses/SystemConvolution` arrives with 4b. LEC output thinning is a **hybrid ladder** — half the targets log-spaced in exceedance (tail density), half linear in consequence (bounding log-log interpolation gaps across the flat bulk), first/last always retained. Interim alongside N7–N9: the competing-risks inputs and cumulative-incidence outputs are rebuilt as non-strict ascending curves (fragility plateaus at 0/1 are legitimate; the Numerics CIF factory's strict two-list construction is a follow-up item).

Prior status — 2026-07-21 — **v0.13** (risk-engine port corrections ahead of Phase 4; supersedes conflicting text below wherever it appears). These items retarget the Phase 4 engine port away from a verbatim v1.0 reproduction — the legacy compute is demonstrably wrong on LEC tails and system aggregation, and Numerics has since gained the tools to fix it. Full math in [../technical-reference/risk-integration.md](../technical-reference/risk-integration.md) and [../technical-reference/loss-exceedance-curves.md](../technical-reference/loss-exceedance-curves.md); phasing in [../ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) Phases 4 / 4b / 4c.

1. **1D quadrature switches from `AdaptiveSimpsonsRule` to `AdaptiveGaussKronrod`** (G10K21). Drop-in surface (`Integrate()`/`Integrate(List<StratificationBin>)`/`MaxDepth`/`MaxFunctionEvaluations`/`RelativeTolerance`/`StandardError`). Both 1D call sites port: the per-component risk integral and the CVaR integral. §7.3 amended; §7.7 new.
2. **LEC construction is rebuilt exactly** (new §7.7). The v1.0 200-bin log10 histogram plotted at bin midpoints, the raw-power-sum moments (catastrophic cancellation on σ/skew/kurtosis), and the midpoint-trapezoid probability-mass re-derivation are all replaced: probability mass comes from the quadrature weight, the exceedance curve is built exactly from sorted `(mass, consequence)` pairs and thinned to `LECOutputLength` only for output, and moments use a weighted streaming (Welford) accumulation. `LECOutputLength` becomes an output-resolution knob, not a compute-resolution knob.
3. **Additive system risk is redefined to assume strictly independent components** and now produces a true system LEC via FFT convolution (new §7.8). The v1.0 additive path combined only the first two moments and emitted no system LEC. Validation errors if a correlation is supplied under the additive method; the hazard correlation matrix applies to the joint method only. Zero-inflating each defective component curve makes the D-fold convolution exactly equal to enumerating all 2^D component failure/non-failure combinations, via Numerics `EmpiricalDistribution.Convolve`.
4. **Joint system risk exposes the Vegas power transform** for rare-tail capture (§7.8) and **enumerates real component failure/non-failure combinations** instead of convolving per-component conditional means (the defect the legacy `ComponentRiskOutput.vb:39` TODO named). `RiskAnalysisOptions` gains `VegasTailFocusMode`/`VegasTailFocusParameter` with a warm-up-derived γ heuristic.
5. **The adaptive integrator's objective is selectable** via a new `RiskIntegrand` enum on `RiskAnalysisOptions` (default `MeanTotalRisk`). It steers *where the adaptive refinement spends evaluations* — the v1.0 integrator's returned value is discarded; it is used as an adaptive sampler whose side effect populates the risk points. All five risk-type LECs and every risk measure are produced regardless. `TotalProbabilityOfFailure` pairs with `RiskAnalysisMode.Reliability`. §4/§7.7.
6. **Mean-only compute treats composite-mixture weights as exposure probabilities** (§6.4 amended). The v1.0 mean-only path flattens a Mixture consequence into its weighted-mean curve — mean risk correct, variance/VaR/CVaR/tail wrong. v1.1 enumerates the mixture branches as weighted exposure states so the LEC carries the true spread. New `SampleExposureBranches()` on the consequence contract; every non-composite type returns a single unit-weight branch, so nothing else in the engine changes shape.
7. **Verification policy (ratified):** because items 2/4/6 correct real v1.0 tail errors, the **means** are verified against the v1.0 oracles (unchanged, and the free regression gate), while **σ / VaR / CVaR / F-N tails** are verified against new brute-force Monte Carlo oracles, not v1.0 parity. Recorded in [../verification.md](../verification.md). New open questions Q-V/Q-W in §11.

Prior status — **v0.12** (consequence-cluster completion; supersedes conflicting text below wherever it appears):

1. **`ParametricConsequenceFunction` is named `ParametricConsequence`.** The `Function` suffix was inconsistent with every sibling concrete type (`TabularConsequence`, `ParametricResponse`, `ParametricUnivariateHazard`); the class name is the XML element name and hash typeTag, so the choice was made before first landing and is now permanent. §3, §5.5.3, §6.4, and §9 are updated in place.
2. **`CompositeConsequence` hash recipe amended and implemented as a projected identity form** (the second instance of the v0.9 `SystemComponent` exception): typeTag + `CompositeFunctionType` + entry count + per entry (effective weight, child content hash). The original recipe omitted the combine mode — Additive vs Average vs Mixture changes results and must hash; Additive projects weights as 1 (computationally inert there); the persisted form (SelfContained inline vs ByReference `FunctionReference` markers) is never the hash surface, so the serialization mode and child metadata cannot move seeds. Structural wiring follows BestFit `CompositeAnalysis` with its warts fixed (complete self-written markers, id-authoritative resolution, entry-preserving unresolved references); nesting is allowed with a circular-reference validation error (deliberate divergence from BestFit).
3. **Q-I's composite half and Q-J are resolved for the consequence composite** (see §10): declared entry order is semantic (drives sampler ordinals and the hashed order), and identical-content siblings draw independently via `HashCombine(seed, child.CanonicalHash(), ordinal)` — no occurrence-index machinery inside composites. `CompositeHazard`/`CompositeResponse` adopt both rules at Phase 9.
4. **Two v1.0-behavior ratifications**: composite child label-mismatch checks are Warnings (the Phase 3 `FailureMode` downgrade — labels are unhashed metadata and never gate compute), and the composite's legacy child-level `HazardTransform`/`ConsequenceTransform` overrides are dropped (children are live functions that own their interpolation transforms; the hash recipe lists no composite transforms).

v0.11 (2026-07-20, layer boundaries; supersedes conflicting text below wherever it appears):

1. **New normative [§8 Layer boundaries & consumer contract](#8-layer-boundaries--consumer-contract).** What the UI/App/API layers own, how they reference model objects, and what the model library still refuses. Read it before starting the UI phase; it exists so that phase does not invent its own conventions.
2. **Input functions are referenced by `Guid`, not by name.** `IRiskFunction` gains `Id` + `AssignNewId()`, serialized and stripped by `CanonicalizationRules.ModelRules` (identity, never content). BestFit's name-based references are its own documented regret — a rename or collision can silently re-resolve to a different type — and the shared framework's `NodeBase.NodeGuid` is the counter-example.
3. **Two serialization modes.** `RiskSerializationMode { SelfContained, ByReference }` with additive `ToXElement(mode)` overloads; the no-arg overload stays `SelfContained`, so headless callers, verification oracles, and the API are untouched. `ByReference` writes `<FunctionReference Id Name/>` markers resolved through the new `IRiskFunctionResolver`, which must return **live** instances — that is what stops an embedded copy from shadowing an edit made where the function is stored. Policy mirrors `RiskElementResolver`: ids authoritative and loud, names lenient and reported.
4. **The mode cannot move a seed.** `SystemComponent.CanonicalHash()` hashes projected failure modes, which always serialize inline; `FailureMode`/`ResponseStage` take no mode. Directly tested — a project's results must not depend on how the project was saved.
5. **Components are analysis-owned.** They are not independently creatable in the UI/App; `RiskAnalysis` will own them and serialize **options only**, receiving components and results through its constructor (the BestFit `new UnivariateAnalysis(dist, xElement, results)` shape). This supersedes any reading of §3 that implies a component is a standalone stored item.
6. **Change propagation.** Elements re-raise their wrapped functions' notifications and the graph forwards element changes, so a consuming layer can invalidate stale results when a shared input is edited.

v0.10 (2026-07-20, namespace reorganization; supersedes conflicting text below wherever it appears):

1. **The `Models` namespace segment is retired.** The library's public shape is now `Core` / `Core.Enums` / `Core.Interfaces` / `RiskFunctions.*` / `Systems.*` / `Analyses` / `Results`, mirroring the sibling Hydrologics library. Folders mirror namespaces exactly; the per-cluster `Support` folders (which declared their parent's namespace and therefore violated that rule) are gone. **Every enum lives in `Core.Enums`, every interface in `Core.Interfaces`** — one type per file. §3 below is rewritten to this layout and is normative.
2. **Plural namespace segments.** `Systems`, `Hazards`, `Transforms`, `Responses`, `Consequences`. A singular `System` segment would shadow the BCL `System` namespace from inside every `RMC.TotalRisk.*` namespace (CS0234) and break any consumer writing `using RMC.TotalRisk;` (CS0104); a singular `Transform` segment shadows `Numerics.Data.Transform` (this one was caught by the compiler mid-refactor, not in theory). Type names remain singular — `SystemComponent`, `TabularTransform`.
3. **Runtime type discriminators.** `HazardFunctionType`, `TransformFunctionType`, `ResponseFunctionType`, `ConsequenceFunctionType`, and `RiskElementType` are exposed as `FunctionType`/`ElementType` properties on the cluster contracts (the Hydrologics `LossMethodType MethodType` pattern), giving results labeling, the future UI, and the REST/MCP layer something to branch on besides type tests. They are **never serialized**: the `ToXElement()` element name remains the serialization and canonical-hash discriminator, so the discriminators add no hash surface. Serializing one would be a hash break — the landing checklist says so explicitly.
4. **Reliability is a mode, not an analysis type.** `ReliabilityAnalysis` is withdrawn in favor of `RiskAnalysisMode { Risk, Reliability }` on `RiskAnalysisOptions`, superseding v0.8 item 7. Both modes walk the same `ComponentGraph` over the same hazard, response, and dependency machinery; a second class would be two implementations of one traversal to keep in agreement. Reliability simply stops before the consequence stage.
5. **Results get their own namespace.** `RMC.TotalRisk.Results` (the `Hydrologics.Output` analog) replaces `Models/RiskAnalysis/Results`, keeping "the model you build" separate from "what you get back" for the Phase 14 API layer.
6. **Hash inertness of the reorganization.** No type was renamed and no serialized attribute changed, so `ToXElement()` output, canonical content hashes, and Monte Carlo seed streams are bit-identical across the move. The hash-invariance and XML round-trip suites passed unchanged and are the evidence.

v0.9 (2026-07-20, Phase 3 session amendment; supersedes conflicting text below wherever it appears):

1. **Formal risk topology inside the model library.** Each `SystemComponent` owns a **`ComponentGraph`** (`Models/RiskAnalysis/Graph/`): a typed, validated, acyclic graph of `IRiskElement` nodes — `HazardElement` (the single root, output-only), `TransformElement`, `ResponseElement`, `ConsequenceElement` (terminal, input-only) — mirroring Hydrologics `IBasinElement`/`BasinModel` (object-reference links stored on the consumer, dual Id+Name serialization through `RiskElementResolver`, Kahn topological sort, clone-map re-linking, name authority). This supersedes §2's "DAG lives in the UI layer only" row and §7.2's UI-conversion story **as follows**: the model-library graph is dependency-free (no DAG.dll reference — that red line stands); DAG.dll/DAGControls remain the UI/App *visualization* layer, and the UI's `RiskDiagram` controls bind to these model types (the `RiskDiagram` name is reserved for the UI). The analysis boundary is unchanged: `RiskAnalysis` consumes a flat `SystemComponent[]` (≤ ~20), components never interconnect, and cross-component hazard correlation stays an analysis-level matrix (engine phase).
2. **Vocabulary refinement.** v0.8's "element purge" narrows: what stays banned is the wpf-framework `ProjectInterfaces.IElement` *wrapper* lingo; the headless DAG node contract is **`IRiskElement`**/`RiskElementBase` per the Hydrologics precedent. `SystemComponent`/`FailureMode` stay concrete (no interfaces), per v0.8.
3. **`FailureModes` are projected.** `SystemComponent.FailureModes` is a fresh, deterministic projection snapshot from graph topology on every access: one `FailureMode` per `ConsequenceElement` in graph **declared order**; transforms classify into stages around responses; a response-free path is the (≤ 1) non-failure mode in canonical stage form. `AddFailureMode(FailureMode)` expands a chain-style mode into wired elements (lossless — bit-identical hash — for failure chains). `FailureMode` remains independently constructible; `Parent` wiring feeds the component hazard's labels into continuity validation.
4. **Identity vs persistence split on `SystemComponent`.** `ToXElement()` persists the element graph, whose link attributes carry Guids and names and therefore CANNOT be a hash surface; `CanonicalHash()` hashes an internal **identity form** — options + hazard content + projected failure-mode XML in path order — realizing §5.5.3 exactly. Elements and `ComponentGraph` expose no `CanonicalHash`. Pinned guarantees: element renames, `AssignNewId`, canvas moves, and description edits are hash-inert; independently built equal-content components hash identically (occurrence indices per §5.5.4 disambiguate).
5. **Response chains via `ResponseStage`.** `FailureMode` generalizes to ordered stages (path grammar `T* (R T*)* C`) plus trailing `ResponseToConsequence` transforms and an ordered `ConsequenceFunctions` list (index 0 = the primary type used for integration; all types — e.g., economic and life loss — are computed and tracked). The v1.0 members (`HazardToResponse`, `ResponseFunction`, `ConsequenceFunction`) survive as views over stage 0. A downstream response applies to both branches of the upstream response — engine semantics land with the compute phase; the structure records response order now.
6. **Structural, label-free hazard binding.** `ConsequenceElement.HazardSource` optionally references any upstream hazard/transform output on the terminal's own path (e.g., consequences given peak flow while the chain transformed flow→stage); the projection converts the reference to `(ConsequenceHazardDimension, ConsequenceHazardPosition)` — position 0 = the raw hazard, k = after the k-th stage transform; the null default resolves-on-write to the last response's input (exact v1.0 behavior); trailing transforms always fold from the bound position. This generalizes §6.5's `ConsequenceHazardBinding` enum. `SpecifiedHazard`-family labels stay unhashed display metadata — a rename can never rewire compute — and chain label mismatches are downgraded from v1.0 errors to advisory warnings. `ComponentGraph.GetAvailableHazardSources` is the discoverability API (UI/agent binding pickers), reused by validation so picker and validator agree by construction.
7. **Bivariate ports now, functions Phase 11.** Elements expose `InputCount`/`OutputCount`; every connection serializes a `SourcePort` (port 1 ↔ `HazardDimension.Secondary`); `ResponseElement.SecondaryInput` and the `SecondarySource*` attributes are reserved (error while the wrapped response is univariate); `FailureMode.HazardBinding`/`ConsequenceHazardDimension` land now (Secondary errors until bivariate hazards exist). Phase 11 changes output-arity getters and validation only — zero serialized-shape breaks.
8. **Consequence pairing and combination bookkeeping.** Fail/non-fail excess pairing is **positional** (index k ↔ k; count mismatch vs the non-failure path = error; paired label/unit mismatch = warning). `MultipleConsequences` re-derives from the last response's fan-out at projection. v1.0's response-function-uniqueness error is dropped (obsolete under inline ownership + occurrence indexing). `CorrelationMatrix` serializes G17 row-major (rows `;`-separated, values `,`-separated) **only** under `DependencyType.CorrelationMatrix` — resolves Q-G; v1.0's braced format never round-tripped (its read loop discarded every parsed value), and auto-mode derived matrices are unserialized state so lazy MVN access cannot perturb hashes. The MVN off-diagonal constants (`1 − √εmach`, `−1/(D − 1) + √εmach`) and the CommonCause/MutuallyExclusive dependency coercion port exactly.
9. **Scope moves.** Results containers (`Models/RiskAnalysis/Results`), `SampledComponent`/`SampledFailureMode`, `ComponentRiskOutput`, and `SetupSamplers`/`Sample` land with the risk-engine phase (Q-N's shared-draw coupling is designed with the compute loop). `SystemRiskType` stays Analyses-level. `ProfileHazardFunction` is deferred to the results design (new Q-T). `CreatePRNGs`/`ClearPRNGs` are not ported (content-based seeding). New Q-U tracks the engine semantics of `MultipleConsequences` under response fan-out.

v0.8 (2026-07-20, same-day amendment ratified during the Phase 1–2 planning session — its items remain ratified except where v0.9 supersedes):

1. **v1.0 API preservation.** The input-function domain surface is preserved verbatim from the v1.0 implementation (`RMC.TotalRisk.IO` C# port, cross-checked against the VB engine): property names/types/defaults, `SampleFunction` overload shapes/returns, `Min/Max*` shapes, the `Estimate()` lifecycle, and legacy enum names. The analysis layer instead adopts a growth foundation (see #7). The future UI layer maps v1.0 projects onto the v1.1 analysis API on import.
2. **Model/UI vocabulary separation — element purge, and no root abstraction.** "Element" is wpf-framework UI lingo (`ProjectInterfaces.IElement`); it is reserved for the future UI layer exactly as `RMC.BestFit.UI\Elements\` does. The kernel contract is **`IRiskFunction`** with implementation base **`RiskFunctionBase`** — replacing this doc's `IModelElement`/`ModelElementBase`/`SampledModelElement`; `CanonicalizationRules.ModelElementRules` → **`ModelRules`**. **No `IModel`/`ModelBase` root is introduced**: BestFit's `IModel` exists because its estimation engines calibrate *any model* polymorphically; TotalRisk's engine consumes functions **by role** (hazard → transform → response → consequence) and has no "any model" consumer. The genuine polymorphic abstractions are exactly: `IRiskFunction` (sampler/seed orchestration walks heterogeneous function chains), the four cluster interfaces (multiple concretes, consumed by role), and `IAnalysis` (multiple analysis types, uniform lifecycle). `SystemComponent`/`FailureMode` stay concrete classes implementing `Validate`/`ToXElement`/`CanonicalHash` directly (v1.0 parity: `SystemComponent` has `Name`+`Clone()`; `FailureMode` has `Clone()` but no `Name`).
3. **Legacy enum names, standalone files**: `DependencyType`, `FailureModeMethod`, `JointConsequenceType`, `SystemRiskType`, `RiskType`, `FunctionUncertainty` (one per file, in cluster Support folders) — replacing this doc's `FailureModeDependency`/`JointConsequencesType`/`SystemRiskMethod` names. `NonFailResponse` becomes a plain instantiable type (no singleton); non-fail identification is a type test. `TabularHazard.NoUncertainyFunction` typo is fixed to `NoUncertaintyFunction` before entering the permanent XML/hash contract. `TabularResponse.SampleResponseFunction(int)` semantic changes from seed to realization index per §5.8.
4. **Risk results go System.Text.Json** (supersedes §7.5's XElement bullet): v1.0 persisted results as compressed BinaryFormatter BLOBs (removed from .NET 9+). v1.1 results containers are redesigned JSON-first — explicit public serializable state (v1.0's `Curve` hid moments/bin parameters in private fields), `ToJson()`/`FromJson()` (+ compressed-bytes overloads), in-memory only. Model *definition* types keep `ToXElement()` as the canonical-hash identity surface. v1.0 result BLOBs are not readable; old projects re-run their analyses.
5. **Posterior injection on parametric types**: `Estimate()` bootstrap is the default; `Estimate(IList<ParameterSet>)` accepts externally fitted posteriors (BestFit UnivariateAnalysis/Bulletin17C/PointProcess reduce to Numerics `ParameterSet` lists, passed by the UI importer). `CompositeHazard` gains the same option at its phase for BestFit competing-risks/mixture/composite imports. Open question: this injection path likely supersedes the planned `BestFitUnivariateHazard` type — resolve at the composites phase (bivariate/coincident import types unaffected).
6. **Uncertainty-results contract**: every function implements `UncertaintyAnalysisResults ComputeUncertaintyResults(double confidenceIntervalWidth = 0.9)` on `IRiskFunction`. The v1.0 app-layer code-behind visualization math (per-ordinate percentile plotting) moves into the model library. Tabular types evaluate **exact co-monotonic percentile curves** (deterministic — CI bounds `CurveSample((1∓w)/2)`, median `CurveSample(0.5)`, mean via the type's mean assembly; no simulation); parametric types surface their stored bootstrap/imported `Results` and re-slice CIs from `ParameterSets` for a different width. One machinery, three consumers: UI plots, `RiskAnalysisOptions.ConfidenceIntervalWidth`, and the REST API.
7. **Analysis-layer growth foundation**: `RiskAnalysisOptions` extraction is ratified (v1.0 option property names/defaults preserved on the options class; `EstimateMeanRiskOnly` defaults `true` as in v1.0); a **`ReliabilityAnalysis`** sibling (failure probability / AFP without consequences) joins `Analyses`; a future **`CostBenefitAnalysis`** owning a `List<RiskAnalysis>` of alternatives is the design driver for keeping every analysis fully self-contained (components + options + results in one serializable object).
8. **Placement fixes**: `SamplingScheme` lives in `Models/Support` (needed by `RiskFunctionBase`); `FunctionHelpers` lives in `Models/Support` (no types in the bare root namespace). Phase numbering references below (§9) are superseded by [../ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md).

v0.7 (2026-07-20): Moved to its authoritative home in the RMC-TotalRisk repo (v1.1 development), and **§5.6 reversed**: no per-file license headers — the USACE notice lives in the repo `LICENSE` only, with Authors in each class's XML `<remarks>` (repo-bootstrap decision). v0.6 (2026-07-19): **Shared-functions decision ratified** — see [SHARED_FUNCTIONS_STRATEGY.md](SHARED_FUNCTIONS_STRATEGY.md). The input-function *math* layer becomes an expansion of `Numerics.Functions` (new migration Phase 2.0); `RMC.BestFit.dll` is **removed** from the model lib's planned dependencies (the `BestFit*` types become posterior-import types holding Numerics artifacts); and §5.5's canonical hashing switches from per-class `WriteCanonical` binary writers to **XML canonicalization** over `ToXElement()` (the mechanism Hydrologics built from this doc's v0.5 spec, adopted back). v0.5 (2026-04-30) added bivariate hazards (`ParametricBivariateHazard`, `BestFitBivariateHazard`, `BestFitTabularHazard`), bivariate-aware `SystemComponent` / `FailureMode` dimensional binding, and new types per cluster: `CompositeTransform`, `BestFitTransform`, `ParametricConsequenceFunction`, `FaultTreeResponse` (v2 placeholder). Renames `ParametricHazard` → `ParametricUnivariateHazard` and `BestFitHazard` → `BestFitUnivariateHazard`. v0.4 introduced per-function `SetupSampler`; v0.3 introduced LHS; v0.2 introduced occurrence-index seeding. §5.8, §6.5, and §7.4 remain deliberate departures from v1 needing careful review before porting begins; §5.5's review completed 2026-07-19 (v0.6 — XML canonicalization adopted).

**Audience**: engineers porting code from `RMC.TotalRisk.IO` to `RMC.TotalRisk`; future Claude sessions resuming Phase 2; the future Phase 5 REST API author.

## 1. Purpose & non-goals

`RMC.TotalRisk.dll` is the headless Monte Carlo compute engine for life-safety dam and levee risk analyses. Its only job: take a typed system definition (system components, failure modes, hazard/transform/response/consequence functions, run options) plus a seed → produce typed, **reproducible** results.

**In scope**:
- All pure-compute types currently entangled in `RMC.TotalRisk.IO`.
- Monte Carlo engine with `Parallel.For` over realizations.
- `XElement` round-trip serialization (in-memory; persistence is a caller concern).
- Validation via `(bool IsValid, List<string> ValidationMessages) Validate()`.
- **Stable, content-based seeding** — resolves the v1 reproducibility bug where canvas position changes drift MC results.

**Out of scope** (call-site responsibility):
- Persistence (SQLite, file paths, encryption) — caller passes `XElement` in/out.
- UI (WPF, XAML, PropertyGrid binding, `Dispatcher`, `Bitmap` icons).
- Project model (singleton `Project.Current`, element collections, name-based function lookup).
- Diagram visualization (canvas, drag-drop, Bezier connectors) — UI concern, see DAG/DAGControls.
- Dialogs, `MessageBox`, file/save prompts.
- Logging infrastructure — the lib produces validation messages and exceptions; the caller wires whatever logger.

## 2. Headless constraints

The headless constraints, and the discipline calls each implies:

| Constraint | Implication for design |
|---|---|
| No WPF / `System.Windows.*` | TFM `net10.0`, not `net10.0-windows`. No `Dispatcher`, `DependencyProperty`, `IValueConverter`. |
| No singletons | `Project.GetInstance()` removed. References to other model objects pass via constructor or method args. |
| No direct file I/O | No `File.ReadAllText`, no `SQLiteManager`. `XElement` round-trip is the only serialization contract. |
| No SQLite / DatabaseManager / FlowGraph / ProjectInterfaces / RMC-framework UI DLLs | All stripped at port time. |
| Deterministic entry points | Reproducible runs with explicit seeds. No dialog prompts. |
| `INotifyPropertyChanged` is allowed | Passive contract; headless callers don't subscribe. Provides clean WPF data-binding for the future UI layer. |
| Allowed sibling deps | **Numerics only** (v0.6 — same red line as Hydrologics). BestFit fitted results are imported as Numerics artifacts, not via `RMC.BestFit.dll`. DAG.dll stays in the UI layer only (v0.9: the model library owns its own dependency-free risk topology — `ComponentGraph` inside `SystemComponent`; DAG.dll/DAGControls remain the UI *visualization* binding to it). |
| Bit-stable float encoding | Doubles cross machine/runtime via `BitConverter.DoubleToInt64Bits`. Format with `"G17"` + `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture`. |

## 3. Solution & folder layout

Folders mirror namespaces exactly; there are no types in the bare `RMC.TotalRisk` root namespace and no `Support` folders. Final namespace map under root namespace `RMC.TotalRisk` (v0.10):

*(v0.10: the `Models` segment and the per-cluster `Support` folders are retired; every enum lives in `Core/Enums/` and every interface in `Core/Interfaces/`. Namespace segments that could shadow a BCL or Numerics identifier are plural — `Systems`, `Hazards`, `Transforms`, `Responses`, `Consequences` — because `RMC.TotalRisk.System` would hide the BCL `System` namespace from inside every `RMC.TotalRisk.*` namespace, and a singular `Transform` segment hides `Numerics.Data.Transform`.)*

Note divergence from legacy flat `TotalRisk` namespace — every ported type's namespace changes during the port.

## 4. Public API surface

What a headless caller imports:

```csharp
using RMC.TotalRisk.Analyses;
using RMC.TotalRisk.Core.Enums;
using RMC.TotalRisk.RiskFunctions.Hazards;
using RMC.TotalRisk.RiskFunctions.Transforms;
using RMC.TotalRisk.RiskFunctions.Responses;
using RMC.TotalRisk.RiskFunctions.Consequences;
using RMC.TotalRisk.Systems.Components;

// Build a system definition (parameters come from JSON, agentic input, etc.)
var hazard = new ParametricHazard(parentDistribution: lp3Fitted, /* ... */);
var transform = new LinearTransform(alpha: 1.0, beta: 0.5, /* ... */);
var response = new TabularResponse(orderedPairedData);
var consequence = new TabularConsequence(orderedPairedData);

var fm = new FailureMode
{
    HazardToResponse = { transform },
    ResponseFunction = response,
    ConsequenceFunction = consequence,
};
var component = new SystemComponent { HazardFunction = hazard, FailureModes = { fm } };

// Configure and run
var ra = new RiskAnalysis(new[] { component })
{
    Options = new RiskAnalysisOptions
    {
        Realizations = 10_000,
        PRNGSeed = 12345,
        SamplingScheme = SamplingScheme.LatinHypercube,   // default — see §5.8
        EstimateMeanRiskOnly = false,
        SystemRiskMethod = SystemRiskMethod.AdditiveRisk, // strictly-independent components (v0.13)
        RiskIntegrand = RiskIntegrand.MeanTotalRisk,      // adaptive-refinement objective (v0.13, §7.7)
        // Joint-method tail focus (v0.13, §7.8); ignored under the additive method:
        VegasTailFocusMode = VegasTailFocusMode.Automatic,
    }
};

await ra.RunAsync(progressReporter: null, ct: cancellationToken);

// Read results (typed, deterministic)
EnsembleResults results = ra.RiskResults!;
double meanLEC = results.SystemRiskResults[0].Excess.Mean;
```

The same `RiskAnalysis` instance is what the future WPF UI binds to: it's `INotifyPropertyChanged`, exposes `AnalysisStarting` / `AnalysisCompleted` events, and supports `CancelAnalysis()`.

## 5. Cross-cutting patterns

### 5.1 INotifyPropertyChanged

Direct implementation; no UI dependency. `ModelElementBase` provides:

```csharp
public event PropertyChangedEventHandler? PropertyChanged;
protected virtual void RaisePropertyChange(string? propertyName)
    => PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
```

Setters mutate, then call `RaisePropertyChange(nameof(...))`. Headless callers don't subscribe; the event stays dormant. Future WPF UI binds normally.

### 5.2 Validation

Every model type implements:

```csharp
(bool IsValid, List<string> ValidationMessages) Validate();
```

Mirrors BestFit. Replaces the legacy `BasicMessageItem` + `Messenger` global. Severity, code, source, property name metadata is dropped. Rationale: REST/agentic callers either succeed or get a list of human-readable messages; structured codes can be added in a future v1.x if a real consumer needs them.

### 5.3 XElement serialization

Every concrete model type provides:

```csharp
public T(XElement xElement)        // ctor restores state
public XElement ToXElement();      // writes state
```

The ctor is permissive (null-safe attribute reads, `TryParse` with `NumberStyles.Any`). `ToXElement()` writes attributes for scalars and child elements for nested types. Doubles use `"G17"` + `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture`. No SQLite, no JSON, no `BinaryFormatter`.

When one type holds another (e.g., `WeightedHazardFunction.HazardFunction`), serialization writes the child's full `ToXElement()` inline. **There is no name-based lookup during deserialization** — everything is self-contained. This is the headless replacement for the legacy `Project.GetInstance().FindByName(...)` pattern.

### 5.4 Async / cancellation / progress

`RiskAnalysis : AnalysisBase, IAnalysis` exposes:

```csharp
Task RunAsync(SafeProgressReporter? progressReporter = null, CancellationToken ct = default);
void CancelAnalysis();
event EventHandler<CancelEventArgs>? AnalysisStarting;
event EventHandler<AnalysisRunCompletedEventArgs>? AnalysisCompleted;
bool IsEstimated { get; }
```

`SafeProgressReporter` lives in `Numerics.Utilities` (per BestFit's `IAnalysis`); confirmed headless-clean. The legacy `async void` is rewritten to `Task` for proper exception flow. Cancellation flows through `CancellationToken` rather than `CancellationTokenSource` mutated externally.

### 5.5 Canonical hashing and content-based seeding

This is the single biggest behavioral change vs. v1. **Read carefully — it changes every concrete model type's contract.**

#### 5.5.1 The v1 reproducibility bug

Legacy `RiskDiagram.RefreshSystemComponents()` (Dev repo, `RMC-TotalRisk/RMC.TotalRisk.IO/Project/Elements/Risk Analysis/Support/Diagram/RiskDiagram.cs`) sorts nodes by `(TopPosition, LeftPosition)`. The dictionary preserves insertion order. `RiskAnalysis.Estimate()` (same folder, `RiskAnalysis.cs`) iterates components in that order, handing each one a seed via `prng.Next()`. **Drag a node on the canvas → reorder → different seed → different MC realizations.**

Verbatim from the user: *"a user can create a risk analysis with the exact same input, but change locations in the DAG, and because of the seed dependency, they will get slightly different results."*

A Guid-based fix (one `ComponentGuid` per `SystemComponent`) would resolve canvas-reorder, but two components with identical compute parameters would still get different seeds (different Guids). The user's true ask is stronger: **same numerical/functional inputs → same seed → same results, regardless of all metadata**. The fix below delivers that.

#### 5.5.2 Content-based canonical hashing — the fix (v0.6: XML canonicalization)

> **v0.6 change.** v0.5 specified a per-class `WriteCanonical(BinaryWriter)` on every model type (~35 hand-written binary writers). Hydrologics implemented this doc's v0.5 *semantics* with a leaner *mechanism* — one central, audited canonicalization pass over each type's existing `ToXElement()` — and verified it at stochastic scale (`IdentityInvarianceVerification`). v0.6 adopts that mechanism back. Semantics are unchanged; only the byte source changes. See Hydrologics `docs/requirements/identity-and-seeding.md` and [SHARED_FUNCTIONS_STRATEGY.md](SHARED_FUNCTIONS_STRATEGY.md) D3.

The canonical hash is SHA-256 over a type's `ToXElement()` output after a **canonicalization pass**. `RiskFunctionBase` exposes (v0.8 naming; `SystemComponent`/`FailureMode` implement the same one-liner directly):

```csharp
public byte[] CanonicalHash()
    => CanonicalContentHasher.Hash(ToXElement(), CanonicalizationRules.ModelRules);
```

`CanonicalContentHasher` (adapted from `C:\GIT\Hydrologics\src\Hydrologics\Core\CanonicalContentHasher.cs`):

1. applies the audited strip rules, removing **non-compute** attributes/elements: `Name`, `Description`, `NameOnDisk`, `Guid`, `LeftPosition`, `TopPosition`, unit labels (`SpecifiedHazard`, `HazardUnit`, ...), `ChartSettings` — only content that drives the math survives;
2. encodes the surviving tree with an injective, length-prefixed binary encoding (attributes ordinally sorted; owned-child order preserved as semantic);
3. hashes with SHA-256.

Element names play the role v0.5 assigned to type tags (two different types with identical numeric values cannot collide). Doubles are already bit-stable in XML via the `"G17"` + `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` convention (§5.7), which round-trips ±0, NaN, infinity, and denormals exactly.

**Discipline this imposes**: `ToXElement()` is now the identity surface. Renaming a serialized attribute, reordering owned children, or changing numeric formatting **moves every affected hash and re-rolls seeds**. Serialization is therefore append-only. Every new model property must be classified at landing time — compute-relevant (hashed) or metadata (added to `CanonicalizationRules`) — and covered by the kitchen-sink rename/reorder invariance test (the Hydrologics landing-checklist pattern).

#### 5.5.3 Per-cluster canonical content

Architecture is contract. The tables below enumerate each type's **compute-relevant content**. Under v0.6 they are read as: "typeTag" → the `ToXElement()` element name; each listed field → an attribute/child *retained* by the canonicalization pass; everything else on the element is stripped. Each cluster's port-PR lands its `CanonicalizationRules` entries and hash-invariance tests matching this:

**Transforms**:

| Type | Canonical fields (in declared order) |
|---|---|
| `LinearTransform` | typeTag, Alpha, Beta, IsUncertain, [Sigma if uncertain], Minimum, Maximum |
| `PowerTransform` | typeTag, Alpha, Beta, Xi, IsUncertain, [Sigma if uncertain], IsInverse, Minimum, Maximum |
| `TabularTransform` | typeTag, HazardTransform, TransformTransform, SortOrder, ordinate count, per-ordinate (x, dist-type tag, dist params) |
| `CompositeTransform` | typeTag, CompositeFunctionType, weighted-list count, per entry (effective weight — coerced to 1 under Additive — and sub.CanonicalHash) — a **projected identity form**, like the sibling composites. *(Amended at implementation, 2026-07-25: only `Average` is supported; the mode is hashed anyway so enabling another later cannot silently reinterpret a stored model.)* |
| `BestFitTransform` | typeTag, imported `RatingCurve` posterior bytes |
| `WeightedTransformFunction` | typeTag, weight, transformFunction.CanonicalHash |

**Univariate hazards**:

| Type | Canonical fields |
|---|---|
| `ParametricUnivariateHazard` | typeTag, fitted `Results.UncertaintyAnalysisResults` posterior parameter sets |
| `BestFitUnivariateHazard` | typeTag, source-analysis-type tag, imported posterior bytes |
| `NonparametricHazard` | typeTag, EffectiveRecordLength, HazardTransform, ProbabilityTransform, ordinate count, ordinate parameters |
| `TabularHazard` | typeTag, transforms, ordinate count, ordinate parameters |
| `RFAHazard` | typeTag, regional dataset hash, parametric model parameters |
| `CompositeHazard` | typeTag, **CompositeCombinationType**, DependencyType, CorrelationMatrix, HazardTransform, ProbabilityTransform, weighted-list count, per entry (effective weight and sub.CanonicalHash) — a **projected identity form**. *(Amended at implementation, 2026-07-25: the original row omitted the combination mode and the interpolation transforms, the same omission the `CompositeConsequence` row was amended for. Three coercions keep inert edits from re-rolling seeds — weights project as 1 under CompetingRisks, the dependence projects as Independent under Mixture, and the matrix projects empty outside the one mode that reads it.)* |
| `WeightedHazardFunction` | typeTag, weight, hazardFunction.CanonicalHash |

**Bivariate hazards** (new in v1.1.0):

| Type | Canonical fields |
|---|---|
| `ParametricBivariateHazard` | typeTag, MarginalX.CanonicalHash, MarginalY.CanonicalHash, copulaTypeTag, copulaParams, SecondaryIntegrationBins |
| `BestFitBivariateHazard` | typeTag, imported BivariateAnalysis posterior bytes, SecondaryIntegrationBins |
| `BestFitTabularHazard` | typeTag, imported (X, Y, Z) coincident-frequency table bytes |

**Responses**:

| Type | Canonical fields |
|---|---|
| `ParametricResponse` / `TabularResponse` / `NonFailResponse` | analogous to corresponding hazard types |
| `BivariateResponse` | typeTag, surface ordinates, PrimaryHazardType, SecondaryHazardType |
| `EventTreeResponse` | projected tree identity: hazard axis, source content, terminal failure classification, topology, target subtree/function canonical identities, and link mode; IDs/names/reference wrappers stripped; canonical occurrence paths replace persistence IDs |
| `FaultTreeResponse` | projected tree identity: hazard axis, gates/K/basic-source content/topology, target canonical identities, and shared-logical versus independent-clone mode; IDs/names/reference wrappers stripped; commutative gate inputs sorted by child canonical hash. *(Implementation note, 2026-07-31: shared-logical unification is encoded through `SharedVariable` first-occurrence ordinals in the projected form — the surface that distinguishes `AND(A,A)`-shared from two content-identical independent events.)* |
| `CompositeResponse` | typeTag, **CompositeCombinationType**, DependencyType, CorrelationMatrix, HazardTransform, ProbabilityTransform, weighted-list count, per entry (effective weight and sub.CanonicalHash) — a **projected identity form**, identical recipe to `CompositeHazard`. *(Amended at implementation, 2026-07-25.)* |
| `WeightedResponseFunction` | typeTag, weight, responseFunction.CanonicalHash |

**Consequences**:

| Type | Canonical fields |
|---|---|
| `TabularConsequence` | typeTag, ordinates |
| `LifeSimConsequence` | typeTag, imported `UncertainOrderedPairedData` ordinates |
| `ParametricConsequence` | typeTag, Alpha, Beta, Threshold, UpperBound, IsUncertain, [SigmaAlpha, SigmaBeta if uncertain] |
| `CompositeConsequence` | typeTag, **CompositeFunctionType**, weighted-list count, per entry (effective weight — coerced to 1 under Additive — and sub.CanonicalHash) — a **projected identity form** (the second instance of the ratified `SystemComponent` exception): the persisted form is never the composite's hash surface, so serialization mode and child metadata cannot move the hash. *(Amended at implementation, 2026-07-21: the original row omitted the combine mode, but Additive vs Average vs Mixture changes results and must hash; entry order is hashed — declared order is semantic.)* |
| `WeightedConsequenceFunction` | (no hash surface of its own — the owning composite projects weight + child hash per entry) |

**Risk analysis**:

| Type | Canonical fields |
|---|---|
| `FailureMode` | typeTag, HazardBinding enum, ConsequenceHazardBinding enum, HazardToResponse list, ResponseToConsequence list, ResponseFunction.CanonicalHash, ConsequenceFunction.CanonicalHash, MultipleConsequences flag |
| `SystemComponent` | typeTag, HazardFunction.CanonicalHash, HazardThreshold, FailureModeMethod, JointConsequences, FailureModeDependency, CorrelationMatrix bytes, FailureModes count, [FailureModes[i].CanonicalHash in declared order] |
| `RiskAnalysisOptions` | typeTag, Realizations, PRNGSeed, SamplingScheme, EstimateMeanRiskOnly, ConfidenceIntervalWidth, LECOutputLength, ConsequenceThreshold, Alpha, SystemRiskMethod |

#### 5.5.4 Seed derivation: the independence/stability paradox

Naively combining `PRNGSeed` with `component.CanonicalHash()` alone is INCORRECT. It satisfies cross-analysis stability (rename-invariant, reorder-invariant) but breaks **within-analysis independence**: two components with identical compute parameters in the same analysis would receive identical seeds, giving perfectly positively-correlated knowledge-uncertainty draws. That is wrong — the statistical model assumes independent uncertainty per function instance.

The two requirements appear contradictory:

| Requirement | Implies |
|---|---|
| Two analyses with the same multiset of components → same MC results | Seed must depend on content alone |
| Two identical-content components in the same analysis → independent samples | Seed must NOT depend on content alone |

They are reconciled by introducing a third axis: the **occurrence index within the multiset of identical-content components**.

For each component in the analysis, assign an `OccurrenceIndex` defined as:

> *the number of OTHER components in this analysis that have the same `CanonicalHash` and appear before this component in the canonical ordering (sort by `CanonicalHash`, then by declared array index for ties).*

Equivalently: for each unique canonical hash `h`, the `n_h` components with that hash get occurrence indices `0, 1, …, n_h − 1` in stable-sorted order.

Each component's seed is then:

```csharp
componentSeed = SeedHelpers.HashCombine(
    Options.PRNGSeed,
    component.CanonicalHash(),
    component.OccurrenceIndex);
```

```csharp
// In RiskAnalysis.RunAsync(), before any sampling:
AssignOccurrenceIndices(Components);  // populates each component's OccurrenceIndex

foreach (var component in Components)
{
    int componentSeed = SeedHelpers.HashCombine(
        Options.PRNGSeed, component.CanonicalHash(), component.OccurrenceIndex);
    component.CreatePRNGs(componentSeed, Options.Realizations);
}

private static void AssignOccurrenceIndices(IReadOnlyList<SystemComponent> components)
{
    var byHash = new Dictionary<string, int>();  // hash hex → next occurrence
    var sorted = components
        .Select((c, declaredIdx) => (c, declaredIdx))
        .OrderBy(t => t.c.CanonicalHash(), ByteArrayComparer.Instance)
        .ThenBy(t => t.declaredIdx)
        .ToArray();
    foreach (var (c, _) in sorted)
    {
        var key = Convert.ToHexString(c.CanonicalHash());
        var occ = byHash.TryGetValue(key, out var v) ? v : 0;
        c.OccurrenceIndex = occ;
        byHash[key] = occ + 1;
    }
}

public static int HashCombine(int globalSeed, byte[] componentHash, int occurrenceIndex)
{
    Span<byte> tail = stackalloc byte[8];
    BinaryPrimitives.WriteInt32LittleEndian(tail[..4], globalSeed);
    BinaryPrimitives.WriteInt32LittleEndian(tail[4..], occurrenceIndex);
    using var sha = SHA256.Create();
    sha.TransformBlock(tail.ToArray(), 0, 8, null, 0);
    sha.TransformFinalBlock(componentHash, 0, componentHash.Length);
    return BinaryPrimitives.ReadInt32LittleEndian(sha.Hash!.AsSpan(0, 4));
}
```

`OccurrenceIndex` is a runtime-computed property on `SystemComponent` (not persisted to XElement; recomputed at the start of every `RunAsync`). It does not enter the canonical hash itself — it modifies seeding, not identity.

#### 5.5.5 Why this works

**Within-analysis independence** — Two components A1, A2 with identical `CanonicalHash` get distinct occurrence indices (0 and 1) → distinct master seeds → independent SHA256-derived sub-seeds for posterior draws. Knowledge uncertainty samples have correlation ≈ 0 in expectation, matching v1 behavior.

**Cross-analysis stability** — Two analyses with the same multiset of canonical hashes (e.g., both contain `{A, A, B}`) produce the same multiset of `(hash, occurrence)` tuples — `{(A,0), (A,1), (B,0)}` — so the same set of three seeds. The seeds may be assigned to differently-named components in different declared orders, but since identical-content components are mathematically indistinguishable, the total MC contribution is identical.

Worked example. Project P1 declares `[A1, A2, B]`; Project P2 declares `[B, A2′, A1′]` where all four A's have identical content:

| Project | Canonical-sort + declared-tiebreak | (hash, occ) tuples | Seeds |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | `[A1, A2, B]` | `(A,0)→A1, (A,1)→A2, (B,0)→B` | `s_A0, s_A1, s_B0` |
| P2 | `[A2′, A1′, B]` | `(A,0)→A2′, (A,1)→A1′, (B,0)→B` | `s_A0, s_A1, s_B0` |

Identical seed sets. Total contribution `Σ MC(A, s_A0) + MC(A, s_A1) + MC(B, s_B0)` is the same in both projects.

**Robust under canvas/rename/description edits** — none of these enter the canonical hash or the occurrence index. Identical seeds, identical results.

**Robust under unrelated additions** — adding a new component with a *different* canonical hash leaves all existing `(hash, occurrence)` tuples untouched. Existing components keep their seeds. Only the new component's contribution is added.

**Adding/removing a duplicate is structurally meaningful** — adding a second copy of an existing component bumps the occurrence indices for all existing peers with the same hash. Their seeds change. This is correct: the analysis is now genuinely different (more weight on that risk path).

**Joint-risk combination matrix** (`_eCombos`) — column `k` corresponds to the component at canonical-sorted-then-declared-tiebreak position `k`. Identical-content components occupy adjacent columns; their inclusion-exclusion roles are interchangeable, so the integration result is invariant under their swap.

**Within a component**, the existing `_prng.Next()` cascade through failure modes / transforms / leaf samplers in declared order is preserved. Two failure modes with identical content within the same component already get distinct sub-seeds via consecutive `prng.Next()` calls — that within-component independence does not require an occurrence-index scheme.

#### 5.5.6 Caveat: failure-mode order within a component

The component's canonical hash includes failure modes **in declared order** (per recipe table in §5.5.3). For `FailureModeMethod = CompetingFailures` / `MutuallyExclusive`, declared order is mathematically meaningful (drives correlation-matrix indexing and exclusion logic). For `FailureModeMethod = JointFailures`, FM order is mathematically irrelevant — but this scheme treats `[F1, F2]` and `[F2, F1]` as different content. See open question Q-I.

#### 5.5.7 Properties guaranteed

| Edit | Within-analysis result |
|---|---|
| Drag node on canvas, change `LeftPosition`/`TopPosition` | identical |
| Rename a component or any function | identical |
| Edit Description | identical |
| Reorder the components array in the analysis | identical |
| Add an unrelated component (different canonical hash) | existing components' contributions identical |
| Re-save and reload the project file | identical |
| Edit a numerical parameter (Alpha, Sigma, an ordinate value) | different (correctly — math changed) |
| Toggle `IsUncertain` | different (structural change in sampling) |
| Add a duplicate of an existing component | existing peer with same hash gets a new seed (its occurrence index moved); correct, the analysis changed |
| Delete one of two identical components | surviving peer's seed changes; correct, the analysis changed |

| Cross-analysis comparison | Result |
|---|---|
| Two analyses, same multiset of canonical hashes, any declared order | identical |
| Two analyses, same hashes but different `Realizations` or `PRNGSeed` | different (correctly — run options changed) |

| Within-analysis independence check | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Two components with identical canonical hash, occurrence 0 and 1 | independent posterior draws (correlation ≈ 0 across 10k+ realizations) |
| Two failure modes with identical content within the same component | independent draws via existing `_prng.Next()` cascade |
| Two transforms with identical content in the same `HazardToResponse[]` chain | independent draws via existing `prng.NextDouble()` cascade |

#### 5.5.8 Seed-stable perturbation mode (Phase 6.6 — implemented)

Editing a single numeric parameter changes the canonical hash → changes the MC seed → changes the realization noise on top of the parameter sensitivity. That is the **correct default**: reproducibility demands that different content produce a different, deterministic stream. But in a perturbation study (Δresult/Δparameter) the seed re-roll is noise on top of the signal, so the engine exposes the seed-stable mode this section originally deferred:

- **`RiskAnalysis.CapturedSamplerSeeds`** (`SamplerSeedMap?`, runtime-only): every run captures the *effective* seed it resolved at each sampler walk ordinal — per component, per function position including the failure modes' consequence-coupling positions — plus the joint system's VEGAS seed base. `capture(apply(map)) = map`.
- **`RiskAnalysis.PinnedSamplerSeeds`** (`SamplerSeedMap?`, runtime-only): when set, the next run substitutes each captured seed for the content-derived one, by walk ordinal, through a `SeedScribe` threaded down the same `SetupSamplers` walk that defines seeding order. Pinning is **per function ordinal**, not per component: the perturbed parameter moves *that function's* hash, so a component-level pin would still re-roll its percentile matrix.
- **Workflow:** baseline run → read `CapturedSamplerSeeds` → perturb the parameter → assign the map to `PinnedSamplerSeeds` on the perturbed analysis → run → difference the results.
- **Shape validation is loud:** a map only fits the walk shape it was captured from. Component-count mismatch throws synchronously from `RunAsync`; a walk-ordinal mismatch (a mode, function, or coupling position added or removed) faults the run through `AnalysisCompleted` — a perturbation that changes the walk shape is not a "small perturbation."
- **Never persisted:** the map and the pin are runtime-only — never serialized, never hashed, never part of any identity surface. Clearing `PinnedSamplerSeeds` restores content-based seeding exactly.

**Documented residuals** (deterministic parameter effects, not seed noise — the pin removes only the stream re-roll):

1. *Adaptive refinement follows the integrand.* The 1D AGK mesh refines on the configured `RiskIntegrand`; a perturbation that moves the objective's values moves the mesh, shifting integrals within the integration tolerance. A consequence-blind objective (`TotalProbabilityOfFailure`) makes probability outputs bit-identical under consequence perturbations.
2. *The joint VEGAS integrand is inherently consequence-bearing* (`expectedFailure + expectedNonFailure`), so a consequence perturbation re-adapts the importance grid deterministically even with the stream pinned. Hash-moving but integrand-inert edits (e.g., `HazardThreshold`) replay bit-identically — the unit-test witness.
3. *Canonical-order flips*: a perturbation that reorders component canonical hashes re-associates the additive convolution at the last bit.

#### 5.5.9 Verification

Every cluster's `RMC.TotalRisk.Verification` parity test asserts:

1. **Reproducibility under metadata edits**: same compute inputs + same `PRNGSeed` + arbitrary irrelevant edits (rename, reorder, position change) → bit-identical results.
2. **Within-analysis independence**: an analysis with two identical-content components → posterior parameter draws across the two components have empirical correlation ≈ 0 (within 10k-realization noise band).
3. **Cross-project equivalence**: two `RiskAnalysis` instances with structurally identical component multisets but different project files / different declared orders / different names → identical aggregate results.
4. **Sensitivity to compute inputs**: change one numeric parameter → results differ in expected direction.
5. **Legacy parity tolerance**: scenario-by-scenario, results match legacy VB `Test_TotalRisk` outputs within agreed tolerance (relative, not bit-exact, since legacy seeds will differ — the parity is statistical convergence at large `Realizations`).

### 5.6 File header

v0.7 (2026-07-20): **No per-file license headers.** Files start with `using` directives; the USACE notice, conditions, and disclaimer live in the repo `LICENSE` file only; every class carries the Authors block in its XML `<remarks>`. This adopts the Hydrologics/Numerics convention and reverses the earlier ruling.

> *(v0.5, superseded)*: every `.cs` file opened with the 29-line USACE notice — "TotalRisk's mission is life-safety; the legal disclaimer rides with every file." The disclaimer now rides with the distribution via `LICENSE`, per the redistribution conditions themselves.

### 5.7 Numeric formatting

- `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` for parse and format (no locale drift).
- `"G17"` format specifier for doubles in `ToXElement()` (round-trip-exact).
- `BitConverter.DoubleToInt64Bits` for canonical-hash byte encoding (handles ±0, NaN, infinity).

### 5.8 Sampling: per-function LHS via `SetupSampler`

Legacy v1 draws every knowledge-uncertainty percentile from a `Random` instance — independent uniform Monte Carlo. At N=1000–10000 realizations the standard error scales as N⁻¹ᐟ². Latin Hypercube Sampling stratifies each marginal and typically cuts variance 5–50× at the same N. LHS at N=1000 generally matches MC at N=10000 for risk integrals.

The Numerics library exposes LHS at `Numerics/Sampling/LatinHypercube.cs`:

```csharp
public static double[,] LatinHypercube.Random(int sampleSize, int dimension, int seed = -1);
public static double[,] LatinHypercube.Median(int sampleSize, int dimension, int seed = -1);
```

Each column is independently Fisher–Yates-shuffled, so columns are uncorrelated. The MersenneTwister seed makes the matrix fully reproducible.

#### 5.8.1 Design principle

**Each function owns its sampler.** Composites, event trees, and leaf functions all expose a uniform `SetupSampler(N, seed, scheme)` method that pre-allocates the function's own `N × D` percentile matrix, where `D` is the function's intrinsic sampling dimension. At realization time, `SampleFunction(int realizationIndex)` reads row `realizationIndex` of that matrix.

This replaces the per-component `PercentileQueue` model from earlier drafts. Three benefits:

1. Composites and event trees get LHS variance reduction *inside* their internal sampling, not just at the boundary.
2. No queue threading or dimension-count bookkeeping at the component level.
3. Each function manages its own state, keeping sampling logic local to where the math lives.

#### 5.8.2 Interface contract

Every function interface — `IHazardFunction`, `ITransformFunction`, `IResponseFunction`, `IConsequenceFunction` — gains:

```csharp
/// <summary>Number of independent uniform draws this function consumes per realization.</summary>
int SamplingDimensions { get; }

/// <summary>
/// Pre-allocate the per-realization sampler. Idempotent; safe to call before every analysis run.
/// Allocates an N×D percentile matrix for this function and recursively sets up sub-function samplers.
/// </summary>
void SetupSampler(int sampleSize, int seed, SamplingScheme scheme);

/// <summary>
/// Returns the realization-index-th sampled function. SetupSampler() must be called first.
/// </summary>
IUnivariateFunction SampleFunction(int realizationIndex);
```

The legacy `SampleFunction()` (mean) and `SampleFunction(double percentile)` overloads are preserved for sensitivity analysis and ad-hoc queries; they don't require `SetupSampler`.

#### 5.8.3 Base implementation

The shared base `Models/Support/RiskFunctionBase.cs` (v0.8 naming) allocates the matrix uniformly across schemes:

```csharp
public abstract class RiskFunctionBase : IRiskFunction
{
    protected double[,]? _percentiles;     // null when SamplingDimensions == 0

    public abstract int SamplingDimensions { get; }

    public virtual void SetupSampler(int N, int seed, SamplingScheme scheme)
    {
        int D = SamplingDimensions;
        _percentiles = D == 0 ? null : scheme switch
        {
            SamplingScheme.LatinHypercube       => LatinHypercube.Random(N, D, seed),
            SamplingScheme.LatinHypercubeMedian => LatinHypercube.Median(N, D, seed),
            SamplingScheme.MonteCarlo           => IndependentUniform(N, D, seed),
            _ => throw new NotSupportedException()
        };
    }

    protected double Percentile(int realizationIndex, int dimension)
        => _percentiles![realizationIndex, dimension];
}
```

`MonteCarlo` uses the same matrix shape but fills it with independent uniform draws — preserves API uniformity, gives legacy behavior on opt-in.

#### 5.8.4 Per-function dimensions

| Function | D | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `LinearTransform`, `PowerTransform` | 1 if `IsUncertain` else 0 | sigma draw |
| `TabularTransform` | 1 | uncertain ordinate percentile |
| `ParametricHazard`, `BestFitHazard`, `ParametricResponse` | 0 | bootstrap index lookup; posterior pre-computed |
| `NonparametricHazard`, `TabularHazard`, `RFAHazard` | 1 | percentile-driven ordinate |
| `TabularResponse`, `NonFailResponse` | 1 | percentile lookup |
| `BivariateResponse` | 0 | deterministic |
| `EventTreeResponse`, `FaultTreeResponse` | local uncertain-source dimensions plus recursively owned referenced-function dimensions; independent link occurrences bind independent canonical occurrences, shared fault events bind once | see §5.8.6 and the normative tree-response design §8 |
| `TabularConsequence`, `LifeSimConsequence` | 1 | percentile-driven `UncertainOrderedPairedData` |
| `CompositeHazard`, `CompositeConsequence` | **0** | *(Corrected 2026-07-25, Phase 9 — this row was pre-Q-V.)* `CompositeConsequence` is 0 under ratified Q-V (branches enumerated, not drawn). `CompositeHazard` is 0 because its mixture is **aleatory**: `SampleFunction(k)` returns a real `Mixture` distribution built from the children sampled at realization k, so no branch is ever selected. Children own their own dimensions and are set up recursively. |
| `CompositeResponse` | **0** | *(Corrected 2026-07-25, Phase 9.)* Same aleatory-mixture reasoning as `CompositeHazard`. |

Bootstrap-driven hazards (`ParametricHazard`, `BestFitHazard`) and the bootstrap response (`ParametricResponse`) use `SampleFunction(int idx)` to look up the idx-th pre-computed posterior parameter set. Their `SamplingDimensions` is 0; their `SetupSampler` records `N` for index-bound checks but allocates no matrix.

#### 5.8.5 Composite recursion

Each composite recursively initializes its sub-functions. Sub-seeds derive from `(parentSeed, ordinal, sub.CanonicalHash)` so identical-content siblings get different seeds:

```csharp
public override int SamplingDimensions
    => (CompositeFunctionType == CompositeFunctionType.Mixture ? 1 : 0)
       + HazardFunctions.Sum(w => 0);   // composite's own dims; subs counted separately

public override void SetupSampler(int N, int seed, SamplingScheme scheme)
{
    base.SetupSampler(N, seed, scheme);   // own mixture-selector dim if any
    for (int i = 0; i < HazardFunctions.Count; i++)
    {
        int childSeed = SeedHelpers.HashCombine(
            seed, i, HazardFunctions[i].HazardFunction.CanonicalHash());
        HazardFunctions[i].HazardFunction.SetupSampler(N, childSeed, scheme);
    }
}

public IUnivariateDistribution SampleFunction(int idx)
{
    var subs = HazardFunctions.Select(w => w.HazardFunction.SampleFunction(idx)).ToList();
    return BuildMixture(subs, GetWeights(), MixtureSelector(idx));
}

private double? MixtureSelector(int idx)
    => CompositeFunctionType == CompositeFunctionType.Mixture
       ? Percentile(idx, dimension: 0)
       : null;
```

#### 5.8.6 Tree responses: recursive LHS-driven evaluation

The legacy event tree cloned its object graph and used local random draws. Phases 10A/10B instead compile event/fault graphs once and participate in the standard sampler lifecycle. Local uncertain sources receive LHS dimensions; referenced response functions own and report their actual nested dimensions; independent link occurrences receive distinct canonical occurrence bindings; shared-logical fault events sample once and reuse the value. Indexed sampling performs no random draw and no public-tree clone. Exact rules, seed invariances, posterior-capacity checks, and verification gates are normative in [EVENT_AND_FAULT_TREE_RESPONSE_DESIGN.md](EVENT_AND_FAULT_TREE_RESPONSE_DESIGN.md) §8.

#### 5.8.7 Component-level orchestration

`SystemComponent` walks its function tree once at the start of `RunAsync`, assigning a structural ordinal to each function and deriving each function's seed from the component's master seed (§5.5.4):

```csharp
public void SetupSamplers(int N, int componentSeed, SamplingScheme scheme)
{
    int ord = 0;
    HazardFunction.SetupSampler(N, FunctionSeed(componentSeed, ord++, HazardFunction), scheme);
    foreach (var fm in FailureModes)
        ord = fm.SetupSamplers(N, componentSeed, ord, scheme);
}

private static int FunctionSeed(int componentSeed, int ordinal, IModelElement fn)
    => SeedHelpers.HashCombine(componentSeed, ordinal, fn.CanonicalHash());
```

`FailureMode.SetupSamplers` calls `SetupSampler` on each of its transforms, its response function, and its consequence function, threading the ordinal counter so each function gets a unique seed.

Per realization, the component samples without any percentile threading:

```csharp
public SampledComponent Sample(int idx, FailureMode? nfMode)
{
    var hazard = HazardFunction.SampleFunction(idx);
    var sampled = FailureModes.Select(fm => fm.Sample(idx, nfMode)).ToList();
    return new SampledComponent(this, hazard, sampled);
}
```

#### 5.8.8 Reproducibility

Same `PRNGSeed` + same `SamplingScheme` + same component canonical hashes → bit-identical LHS matrices at every level → bit-identical results. The §5.5 guarantees (rename-invariant, position-invariant, occurrence-distinguished) carry through unchanged. Switching `SamplingScheme` is the only edit that changes results without changing the underlying math; expose it explicitly via `RiskAnalysisOptions.SamplingScheme` so the user opts in consciously.

```csharp
public enum SamplingScheme
{
    /// <summary>Independent uniform draws; legacy v1 behavior. Variance ∝ 1/√N.</summary>
    MonteCarlo,
    /// <summary>Default. LHS with random placement within bins (unbiased).</summary>
    LatinHypercube,
    /// <summary>LHS with median bin centers; deterministic per seed, useful at very small N.</summary>
    LatinHypercubeMedian,
}
```

Default: `LatinHypercube`.

#### 5.8.9 Verification

`RMC.TotalRisk.Verification` adds:

1. **Variance reduction**: same scenario at N=1000 with `MonteCarlo` vs. `LatinHypercube`, 50 repeated runs each. LHS empirical standard error of LEC mean ≥ 3× lower than MC.
2. **Reproducibility**: same seed + same scheme → bit-identical results.
3. **MC parity**: `SamplingScheme.MonteCarlo` reproduces legacy v1 statistical convergence at large N within tolerance.
4. **Dimension-count audit**: for every cluster parity scenario, assert `function.SamplingDimensions` matches actual `_percentiles` consumption in `SampleFunction(idx)`. Off-by-one in any cluster's port surfaces here.

## 6. Cluster architecture

### 6.1 Hazard Function — cluster #1

Path: `Models/HazardFunctions/`. **Cluster #1 of the migration** per user instruction. Split into univariate and bivariate sub-clusters.

#### 6.1.1 Univariate hazards

Six concrete types. The two imported/posterior types are renamed for clarity:

- `ParametricUnivariateHazard` (renamed from `ParametricHazard`) — user-defined parameters bootstrapped to a posterior.
- `BestFitUnivariateHazard` (renamed from `BestFitHazard`) — posterior-import type for any BestFit univariate analysis (was previously locked to `BayesianEstimation`). v0.6: holds Numerics artifacts (`ParentDistribution` + `ParameterSet[]` / `UncertaintyAnalysisResults`) passed in already-parsed — no `RMC.BestFit.dll` reference; `.rmcbf` reading (SQLite) is a UI-layer concern.
- `NonparametricHazard` — empirical CDF + Weibull extrapolation.
- `TabularHazard` — pure tabular paired data.
- `RFAHazard` — Regional Frequency Analysis.
- `CompositeHazard` — weighted mixture or competing risks over `WeightedHazardFunction[]` of any univariate types.

**Recommendation declined**: do NOT collapse `Parametric*` and `BestFit*` into a single `UnivariateHazard` with a flag. The two have different lineage (user-defined parameters vs. imported posterior bytes), different validation rules, different XElement schemas, and different canonical-hash recipes (parameters vs. posterior bytes). Unifying via a flag would create branching everywhere. They share `UnivariateHazardBase` for genuine commonality (both produce a posterior-indexed `IUnivariateDistribution` from `SampleFunction(int idx)`). Mirrors BestFit's own split between `UnivariateDistribution` (model) and the analyses that estimate it.

#### 6.1.2 Bivariate hazards (new in v1.1.0)

Three concrete types support compound-hazard analyses (e.g., flood depth × flood duration, wind speed × wind direction, primary flow × tributary contribution):

- `ParametricBivariateHazard` — user picks marginal X + marginal Y from existing univariate hazard types, manually sets copula type and parameters. Mirrors BestFit's `BivariateAnalysis`.
- `BestFitBivariateHazard` — posterior-import of a fitted `BivariateAnalysis` (Numerics marginals + copula + `ParameterSet[]` posterior; the UI layer reads the `.rmcbf`).
- `BestFitTabularHazard` — imports a `CoincidentFrequencyAnalysis` result as primitive (X, Y, Z[i,j]) arrays + posterior bounds. Stores the coincident-frequency table directly; no internal integration needed.

Common contract `IBivariateHazardFunction`:

```csharp
public interface IBivariateHazardFunction : IHazardFunction
{
    /// <summary>The marginal X (primary) hazard distribution.</summary>
    IUnivariateHazardFunction MarginalX { get; }

    /// <summary>The marginal Y (secondary) hazard distribution.</summary>
    IUnivariateHazardFunction MarginalY { get; }

    /// <summary>Number of integration bins for Y given X. Default 50.</summary>
    int SecondaryIntegrationBins { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Returns the conditional Y | X discretization at the given X hazard level for the
    /// realization-index-th sampled copula. Each entry is (Y value, conditional probability weight).
    /// Weights sum to 1 across the returned array.
    /// </summary>
    IReadOnlyList<(double Y, double Weight)> SampleConditionalYGivenX(int realizationIndex, double xHazardLevel);
}
```

`IHazardFunction.SampleFunction(int idx)` continues to return the X marginal as `IUnivariateDistribution`. The risk-analysis integrator switches to nested integration when `hazard is IBivariateHazardFunction` (see §7.4).

**`ParametricBivariateHazard`** — user wires existing univariate hazards as marginals, picks a copula from `Numerics.Distributions.Copulas` (Gaussian, Gumbel, Clayton, Frank, Student-t, etc.), supplies copula parameters. The copula is sampled via parameter uncertainty (if any); marginals propagate their own uncertainty. The realization index drives all three samplers together.

**`BestFitBivariateHazard`** — imports fitted marginals + copula + MCMC posterior from BestFit. The realization index looks up the i-th MCMC sample.

**`BestFitTabularHazard`** — imports the (X, Y, Z) coincident-frequency table. `SampleConditionalYGivenX(idx, x)` interpolates the Z column at x to get the Y | X distribution; uncertainty comes from MCMC sample bounds on Z. Suitable when an external coincident analysis has already been done in BestFit.

#### 6.1.3 Original interface

Contract for the cross-cutting `IHazardFunction`:

```csharp
public interface IHazardFunction : IModelElement
{
    string SpecifiedHazard { get; set; }
    string HazardUnit { get; set; }
    bool IsDeterministic { get; }

    // Sampling contract — see §5.8
    int SamplingDimensions { get; }
    void SetupSampler(int sampleSize, int seed, SamplingScheme scheme);
    IUnivariateDistribution SampleFunction(int realizationIndex);

    // Mean and ad-hoc percentile sampling — used for sensitivity / mean-only runs
    IUnivariateDistribution SampleFunction();
    IUnivariateDistribution SampleFunction(double percentile);

    double MinHazard(bool meanOnly);
    double MaxHazard(bool meanOnly);
}
```

#### 6.1.4 Decoupling moves (every cluster)

- Strip `[Browsable]` / `[DisplayName]` / `[Category]` / `Bitmap ElementImage` / `ChartSettings`.
- Replace `ElementBase` inheritance → derive from `HazardFunctionBase : ModelElementBase`.
- Delete `Open()` / `Save()` / `Delete()` / `CopyFromExternal()` SQLite paths → `ToXElement()` / ctor-from-`XElement` only.
- Replace `Messenger` calls + `BasicMessageItem` collection with `Validate()` returning `(bool, List<string>)`.
- Remove `Project.GetInstance()` references; pass instances directly via ctor / property.

What stays in UI: bitmap resources, PropertyGrid metadata attributes, validation message UI surfacing, file-import dialogs.

### 6.2 Transform Function — cluster #2

Path: `Models/TransformFunctions/`. Five concrete types.

> **v0.6**: this cluster is a set of **thin wrappers over the expanded `Numerics.Functions` toolkit** (Phase 2.0 — [SHARED_FUNCTIONS_STRATEGY.md](SHARED_FUNCTIONS_STRATEGY.md) §4): `LinearTransform` → `LinearFunction`, `PowerTransform` → `PowerFunction`, `TabularTransform` → `TabularFunction`, `CompositeTransform` → `CompositeFunction`, `BestFitTransform` → `SegmentedPowerFunction` + `ParameterSet[]` posterior (`EnsembleFunction`). The wrappers add domain labels, validation, serialization glue, and hash identity — zero math.

Concrete types:
- **`LinearTransform`** — `y = α + βx`, optional Gaussian uncertainty.
- **`PowerTransform`** — `y = α(x − ξ)^β`, log-space uncertainty, optional inversion.
- **`TabularTransform`** — paired-data interpolation with optional log axes.
- **`CompositeTransform`** (NEW) — weighted average or mixture over `WeightedTransformFunction[]`. Mirrors `CompositeHazard`: each sub-transform participates with a weight, output is the weighted combination. Useful when a transform is uncertain across multiple expert-elicited or fitted forms (e.g., several rating curves with credibility weights).
- **`BestFitTransform`** (NEW) — posterior-import of a fitted `RatingCurveAnalysis`: a Numerics `SegmentedPowerFunction` + `ParameterSet[]` posterior. Each realization index looks up the corresponding posterior parameter set; produces an `IUnivariateFunction` representing stage→discharge (or whatever the rating curve is). Same import pattern as `BestFitUnivariateHazard` — no `RMC.BestFit.dll`.

`WeightedTransformFunction` (new in `Support/`) follows the same shape as `WeightedHazardFunction`: holds a sub-transform reference + a weight + bubbled `PropertyChanged`. Serialized as an XElement with the sub's full `ToXElement()` inline.

Contract:

```csharp
public interface ITransformFunction : IModelElement
{
    string SpecifiedHazard { get; set; }
    string HazardUnit { get; set; }
    string TransformedHazard { get; set; }
    string TransformedHazardUnit { get; set; }
    bool IsDeterministic { get; }

    int SamplingDimensions { get; }
    void SetupSampler(int sampleSize, int seed, SamplingScheme scheme);
    IUnivariateFunction SampleFunction(int realizationIndex);

    IUnivariateFunction SampleFunction();
    IUnivariateFunction SampleFunction(double percentile);

    double MinHazard();
    double MaxHazard();
    double MinTransformedHazard(bool meanOnly);
    double MaxTransformedHazard(bool meanOnly);
}
```

### 6.3 Response Function — cluster #3

Path: `Models/ResponseFunctions/`. Six concrete response types plus 7 event-node types (the most complex cluster).

Contract:

```csharp
public interface IResponseFunction : IModelElement
{
    string SpecifiedHazard { get; set; }
    string HazardUnit { get; set; }
    bool IsDeterministic { get; }

    int SamplingDimensions { get; }
    void SetupSampler(int sampleSize, int seed, SamplingScheme scheme);
    IUnivariateDistribution SampleFunction(int realizationIndex);
    OrderedPairedData SampleResponseFunction(int realizationIndex);

    OrderedPairedData SampleResponseFunction();
    OrderedPairedData SampleResponseFunction(double percentile);
    IUnivariateDistribution SampleFunction();
    IUnivariateDistribution SampleFunction(double percentile);

    bool IsMonotonic();
    double MinHazard();
    double MaxHazard();
    double MinProbability();
    double MaxProbability();
}
```

Concrete types: `ParametricResponse`, `TabularResponse`, `BivariateResponse`, `NonFailResponse`, `EventTreeResponse`, `CompositeResponse`, `FaultTreeResponse` + `WeightedResponseFunction`.

Tree-response details are specified in [EVENT_AND_FAULT_TREE_RESPONSE_DESIGN.md](EVENT_AND_FAULT_TREE_RESPONSE_DESIGN.md). In summary, `EventTreeResponse` owns initiating/chance/remainder/independent-link nodes and exposes aggregate and stable per-leaf conditional probabilities; `FaultTreeResponse` owns static gate/basic/house/transfer nodes and returns exact top-event conditional probability. Both are response functions, not hazard or risk calculators. `SecondaryHazardNode` is excluded as confirmed inactive legacy code. `WeightedHazardLevel` remains with Phase 11 `BivariateResponse`, not the event-node hierarchy.

#### 6.3.1 BivariateResponse extended for bivariate hazards

Today `BivariateResponse` is wired only to a primary hazard dimension. The v1.1.0 update connects it to a parent component's `IBivariateHazardFunction`:

```csharp
public class BivariateResponse : ResponseFunctionBase
{
    /// <summary>The hazard label this response's primary axis aligns to (must equal MarginalX.SpecifiedHazard on the parent component).</summary>
    public string PrimaryHazardType { get; set; }
    public string PrimaryHazardUnit { get; set; }

    /// <summary>The hazard label this response's secondary axis aligns to (must equal MarginalY.SpecifiedHazard on the parent component).</summary>
    public string SecondaryHazardType { get; set; }
    public string SecondaryHazardUnit { get; set; }

    /// <summary>The 2D failure-probability surface P(F | X, Y).</summary>
    public BivariateSurface Surface { get; set; }

    public double SurfaceProbability(double x, double y);  // bilinear interpolation
}
```

Validation in `SystemComponent`: the FM's BivariateResponse is allowed only when the SC's hazard is bivariate, and the four `(Primary|Secondary)HazardType` strings must match `MarginalX.SpecifiedHazard` and `MarginalY.SpecifiedHazard` exactly.

The owning `FailureMode` exposes `ConsequenceHazardBinding ∈ { Primary, Secondary }` to indicate which dimension feeds the consequence function (which is itself univariate). See §6.5 and §7.4.

#### 6.3.2 EventTreeResponse and FaultTreeResponse

Both are fully designed v1.1 response functions, sequenced as roadmap Phases 10A and 10B. Their responsibility boundary, public model, link semantics, exact event/fault mathematics, manipulation and graph algorithms, LHS recipe, serialization/hash contract, risk-graph branch integration, tests, verification, performance gates, and level-of-effort assessment are normative in [EVENT_AND_FAULT_TREE_RESPONSE_DESIGN.md](EVENT_AND_FAULT_TREE_RESPONSE_DESIGN.md). No `NotImplementedException` placeholder ships as a completed feature.

### 6.4 Consequence Function — cluster #4

Path: `Models/ConsequenceFunctions/`. Four concrete types + helpers.

Concrete types:
- **`TabularConsequence`** — paired-data hazard→consequence with optional uncertainty per ordinate.
- **`LifeSimConsequence`** — imported from a separate LifeSim simulation; treated as a `TabularConsequence` with imported `UncertainOrderedPairedData`.
- **`ParametricConsequence`** (NEW; landed 2026-07-21 — named without the `Function` suffix for cluster consistency with `TabularConsequence`/`ParametricResponse`) — closed-form power model per USACE ER 1110-2-1156 / HEC-FDA conventions:

  ```csharp
  // C(h) = clamp(Alpha * max(h - Threshold, 0)^Beta, 0, UpperBound)
  public double Alpha { get; set; }       // scale
  public double Beta { get; set; }        // exponent
  public double Threshold { get; set; }   // h₀ — no consequence below
  public double UpperBound { get; set; }  // saturation cap
  public bool IsUncertain { get; set; }
  public double SigmaAlpha { get; set; }  // log-space stddev on Alpha
  public double SigmaBeta { get; set; }   // log-space stddev on Beta
  ```

  `SamplingDimensions = IsUncertain ? 2 : 0` (two independent uncertain coefficients when uncertain: α_i = α·e^{σ_α·Z₁}, β_i = β·e^{σ_β·Z₂}). Suitable when a tabular function would over-fit sparse damage data, or when expert elicitation gives parametric form directly. Implementation notes (2026-07-21): the mean-curve overload returns the nominal (median) curve because with exponent scatter and no cap the analytic mean diverges for hazards more than one unit above the threshold (validation warns); sigmas serialize only while `IsUncertain` (recipe-literal conditional hashing); evaluation runs through the exact `ClampedPowerFunction` adapter (threshold-zero and saturation semantics that Numerics `PowerFunction` does not provide).
- **`CompositeConsequence`** (landed 2026-07-21) — weighted mixture / weighted average / additive sum over `WeightedConsequenceFunction[]` (`CompositeFunctionType { Additive, Average, Mixture }`, default Mixture per v1.0). Children are live references to stored functions (the BestFit `CompositeAnalysis` pattern): the stored `ByReference` form carries only (Id, Name, Weight) per entry — no duplicated child content — while `SelfContained` embeds children inline for storeless contexts; unresolvable references keep their weighted entries and are reported by `Validate()`. Nesting is allowed with a circular-reference validation error (deliberate divergence from BestFit, which forbids nesting: pointwise consequence combines are well-defined recursively, and Mixture-over-Additive is a real modeling need).

Contract:

```csharp
public interface IConsequenceFunction : IModelElement
{
    string SpecifiedHazard { get; set; }
    string HazardUnit { get; set; }
    string SpecifiedConsequence { get; set; }
    string ConsequenceUnit { get; set; }
    bool IsDeterministic { get; }

    int SamplingDimensions { get; }
    void SetupSampler(int sampleSize, int seed, SamplingScheme scheme);
    IUnivariateFunction SampleFunction(int realizationIndex);

    IUnivariateFunction SampleFunction();
    IUnivariateFunction SampleFunction(double percentile);

    // v0.13 (Phase 4): mean-only exposure branches. Non-composite types return a single
    // (1.0, meanCurve) entry; CompositeConsequence in Mixture mode returns its child mean
    // curves with their weights (nested composites flatten with multiplied weights).
    IReadOnlyList<(double Weight, IUnivariateFunction Function)> SampleExposureBranches();

    double MinHazard();
    double MaxHazard();
}
```

#### 6.4.1 Mixture consequences under the mean-only path (v0.13, Phase 4)

The v1.0 mean-only compute path calls the parameterless `SampleFunction()`, and
`CompositeConsequence.SampleFunction()` flattens a **Mixture** into its weighted-mean curve
`Σ wᵢ fᵢ(h)` (legacy `CompositeConsequence.vb:951-984`; v1.1 `CompositeConsequence.cs:391`). The
mean annualized risk is then correct — `Σ wᵢ P_F fᵢ = P_F Σ wᵢ fᵢ` — but the LEC that the integrand
records is the *mean curve's* LEC, so the variance, VaR, CVaR and F-N tail all collapse. The
day/night life-loss composite is the canonical failure: the high-consequence night branch is
averaged into the mean instead of surfacing as its own exceedance branch.

Fix: in the mean-only path, do **not** collapse a Mixture. `SampleExposureBranches()` returns the
weighted branches; `SampledFailureMode.ComputeRisk` emits **one risk-point entry per branch** with
probability mass `P_F(h)·wᵢ` and consequence `fᵢ(h)`. No results-container change is needed —
`RiskPoint` already carries parallel `ResponseProbabilities`/`Consequences` lists and
`Curve.CreateCurve` already loops over them. `Additive`/`Average` composites return a single
collapsed curve (those are genuine pointwise sums, not exposure states). A failure mode with
multiple ordered consequence types (the Phase-3 `ConsequenceFunctions` list) takes the **cross
product** of branches across types with product weights, matching the full-MC path where each
composite draws its branch from its own independently seeded dimension; warn above 64 combined
branches, error above 1024 (see open question Q-W for a future *shared exposure state*). This mirrors
into the full-MC path per open question Q-V.

**Q-W shared-exposure design sketch (v0.17 — recorded, not implemented).** When cross-type joint
statistics are requested, the declaration is a per-mode append-only serialized flag (working name
`SharedExposureAcrossTypes`, default false = today's per-type marginal independence, so the
attribute's absence loads forward bit-identically). When set, the mode draws **one** exposure-branch
selector per evaluation shared across all of its consequence positions — the same aleatory day/night
state resolving every type at once — replacing the per-type independent branch axes; the branch
guardrail for such a mode becomes the **max** across positions rather than the sum, because the
positions no longer multiply the recorded entries. The flag is compute-relevant (hashed) by
construction: it changes which joint outcomes exist. Implementation waits for a consumer because
every output produced today is a per-type marginal, which the shared draw provably cannot move —
only cross-type joint measures (e.g., P(life loss > a AND damages > b)) would observe it.

### 6.5 SystemComponent dimensional binding (bivariate hazard support)

Each `FailureMode` declares which hazard dimension it operates on. For univariate hazards this is a no-op; for bivariate hazards it routes the FM's transform/response/consequence chain to either the X or Y marginal.

```csharp
public enum HazardDimension { Primary = 0, Secondary = 1 }

public class FailureMode
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Which hazard dimension feeds this FM's transform → response → consequence chain.
    /// Ignored when the parent component's hazard is univariate (treated as Primary).
    /// </summary>
    public HazardDimension HazardBinding { get; set; } = HazardDimension.Primary;

    /// <summary>
    /// Which hazard dimension feeds the consequence function. Used when ResponseFunction is a
    /// BivariateResponse (the response evaluates at (X, Y) jointly but the consequence is 1D).
    /// Ignored otherwise.
    /// </summary>
    public HazardDimension ConsequenceHazardBinding { get; set; } = HazardDimension.Primary;

    // ... existing fields
}
```

`SystemComponent.Validate()` adds:

| Hazard kind | Constraint |
|---|---|
| Univariate | All FMs must have `HazardBinding == Primary`. UI auto-coerces. |
| Bivariate, FM with non-bivariate response | `HazardBinding ∈ {Primary, Secondary}`; FM transform/response/consequence units must align with the bound marginal's hazard type and unit. |
| Bivariate, FM with `BivariateResponse` | Both response axes must align: `BivariateResponse.PrimaryHazardType == hazard.MarginalX.SpecifiedHazard` and `SecondaryHazardType == hazard.MarginalY.SpecifiedHazard`. `ConsequenceHazardBinding` is required and feeds the consequence function with the chosen marginal. |

Canonical hash of `FailureMode` adds the two binding enums; canonical hash of `SystemComponent` already includes its hazard's canonical hash, which differs between univariate and bivariate types. No additional field needed at the SC level.

## 7. Risk Analysis engine

Path: `Analyses/RiskAnalysis/` (orchestrator) + `Models/RiskAnalysis/` (data + sampled state).

### 7.1 Type relationships

```
RiskAnalysis (Analyses/RiskAnalysis/) : AnalysisBase, IAnalysis
  ├── SystemComponent[] Components             ← injected via ctor
  ├── RiskAnalysisOptions Options              ← Realizations, PRNGSeed, ...
  └── EnsembleResults? RiskResults             ← populated by RunAsync

  ├── void SetupSamplers(N, componentSeed, scheme) ← walks tree, calls SetupSampler on each function (§5.8.7)
  └── SampledComponent Sample(int idx)          ← reads each function's pre-allocated row

FailureMode (Models/RiskAnalysis/Components/)
  ├── List<ITransformFunction> HazardToResponse

  ├── IConsequenceFunction ConsequenceFunction

  └── SampledFailureMode Sample(int idx, FailureMode? nfMode)
```

Per realization, sampling is index-driven and queue-free:

```csharp
SampledComponent sampled = component.Sample(idx, nfMode);
// Inside: each function reads its own pre-allocated _percentiles[idx, :] row.
```

`SamplingScheme.MonteCarlo` uses the same index-driven flow but the matrices contain independent uniform draws instead of LHS-stratified ones — preserves the same call shape.

### 7.2 Topology decoupling

The model lib accepts `SystemComponent[]` directly. **No DAG.dll dependency.** Headless callers (REST, agentic) build the array programmatically. *(v0.9: each component now owns its topology as a `ComponentGraph` — the formal element DAG inside the model library — and projects its `FailureMode` chains from it; the UI's `RiskDiagram : DAG.Graph` controls become a visualization bound to the model graph rather than the source of a conversion.)*

The future `RMC.TotalRisk.UI` (Phase 3) references `DAGControls` (which references `DAG`) for visual editing. At the analysis boundary, the UI converts its `RiskDiagram : DAG.Graph` → flat `SystemComponent[]` and hands it to `new RiskAnalysis(components)`.

```

The `Compute(seed, idx)` per-realization method ports the legacy structure — an adaptive 1D integral per component for the additive/single-component path, `Vegas` for joint risk — but with the v0.13 corrections below. Behavioral changes vs. legacy:

1. Seed source: derived from canonical hashing (§5.5.4).
2. Component ordering for `_eCombos` columns: canonical-hash-sorted, not canvas-position-sorted.
3. Progress reporting via `SafeProgressReporter` (was already there in legacy).
4. Cancellation via `CancellationToken` (was via internal CTS).
5. Bivariate-aware integration: when `component.HazardFunction is IBivariateHazardFunction`, the integrand performs nested Y | X integration (§7.4).
6. **1D integration uses `AdaptiveGaussKronrod`.** AGK integrates the sampled hazard's natural probability support using the existing stratification bins, tolerance `1e-8`, `MaxDepth` 100, `MaxEvaluations` 1e6, and `MinDepth >= 2`. Two endpoint rectangles make the distribution collectively exhaustive; the probability floor is used only where a finite inverse-CDF probe is required, never to stretch the natural integration support.
7. **LEC construction is exact, not histogrammed** (v0.13; §7.7): probability mass comes from the Kronrod weight — the N7 acceptance-aware `Recorder`, adopted Phase 8.5 via `QuadratureMassLedger`; moments use weighted Welford; `LECOutputLength` thins the output only.
8. **`Options.RiskIntegrand`** (default `MeanTotalRisk`) selects the adaptive refinement objective (§4, §7.7). Discontinuous integrands (`TailConditionalRisk`, `ThresholdExceedanceProbability`) inject their discontinuity `p` as an extra stratification-bin boundary.
9. **System aggregation is rebuilt** (v0.13; §7.8): additive assumes strict independence and convolves component LECs via FFT (producing a real system LEC v1.0 never built); joint enumerates true component failure/non-failure combinations and exposes the Vegas power transform.

### 7.4 Bivariate hazard integration

When a component's hazard is bivariate, the outer integration over X probability is unchanged. At each X integration point, the bivariate hazard is asked for `SecondaryIntegrationBins` discretized (Y, weight) pairs from the conditional Y | X distribution. Each FM contributes based on its `HazardBinding`:

```csharp
double IntegrateAtX(SampledComponent sc, int idx, double pX)
{
    bool bivariate = sc.SystemComponent.HazardFunction is IBivariateHazardFunction biv;
    double hX = sc.Hazard.InverseCDF(pX);
    var yBins = bivariate
        ? biv!.SampleConditionalYGivenX(idx, hX)
        : new[] { (Y: hX, Weight: 1.0) };  // univariate: Y collapses to a single point

    double total = 0;
    foreach (var fm in sc.FailureModes)
    {
        if (fm.SystemComponent.ResponseFunction is BivariateResponse br)
        {
            // Bivariate response: evaluate failure surface at (X, Y) pairs
            foreach (var (yVal, w) in yBins)
            {
                double pF = br.SurfaceProbability(hX, yVal);
                double hForC = fm.SystemComponent.ConsequenceHazardBinding == HazardDimension.Primary ? hX : yVal;
                double cF = fm.Consequences.Function(ApplyTransforms(fm.ResponseToConsequence, hForC));
                total += w * pF * cF;
            }
        }
        else
        {
            // Univariate response on either dimension
            double hIn = fm.SystemComponent.HazardBinding == HazardDimension.Primary ? hX : 0;
            if (fm.SystemComponent.HazardBinding == HazardDimension.Secondary)
            {
                foreach (var (yVal, w) in yBins)
                {
                    double th = ApplyTransforms(fm.HazardToResponse, yVal);
                    double pF = fm.Response.CDF(th);
                    double cF = fm.Consequences.Function(ApplyTransforms(fm.ResponseToConsequence, th));
                    total += w * pF * cF;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                double th = ApplyTransforms(fm.HazardToResponse, hX);
                double pF = fm.Response.CDF(th);
                double cF = fm.Consequences.Function(ApplyTransforms(fm.ResponseToConsequence, th));
                total += pF * cF;   // weight = 1 (Y dimension not used)
            }
        }
    }
    return total;
}
```

Univariate hazards collapse to the same code path: `yBins` holds a single `(hX, 1.0)` entry, and `BivariateResponse` is rejected at validation. Performance: bivariate analyses do `SecondaryIntegrationBins` × outer-integrator-evaluation work, typically 30–100× more than univariate. `SecondaryIntegrationBins` defaults to 50; tunable per-hazard.

Joint-risk inclusion-exclusion across multiple bivariate components composes the same way: each component contributes its own integrated risk profile; combinatorial assembly happens at the system level as today.

### 7.5 Results pipeline

`Curve` / `Curves` / `RiskPoint` / `Ensemble` / `*Realization` / `*Results` are pure data containers. Behavioral changes vs. legacy:

- **Strip `[Serializable]` and `BinaryFormatter`** in `SystemRealization` and `EnsembleResults`. **v0.8: replace with System.Text.Json** — results containers are redesigned with explicit public serializable state (v1.0's `Curve` hid moments/bin parameters in private fields) and expose `ToJson()`/`FromJson()` plus compressed-bytes overloads (in-memory only; persistence is a caller concern). Model definition types keep `ToXElement()` (the canonical-hash identity surface); results are JSON. v1.0 BLOBs are not readable — old projects re-run (v1.0 `Open()` already degraded unreadable results to `IsEstimated=false`).
- `Curve.ComputeCentralMoments()` and `ComputeRiskMeasures()` lazy-evaluation logic stays.
- `OrderedPairedData` (Numerics) inputs/outputs preserved.
- Memory cleanup pattern (`DumpMemory()` clearing `RiskPoints` and `Bins` post-aggregation) preserved.

### 7.6 Event lifecycle

Mirrors BestFit `IAnalysis`:

```csharp
ra.AnalysisStarting += (s, e) => { /* last-minute checks; set e.Cancel = true to abort */ };
ra.AnalysisCompleted += (s, e) =>
{
    if (e.Error != null) { /* ... */ }
    else if (e.Cancelled) { /* ... */ }
    else { /* read ra.RiskResults */ }
};
await ra.RunAsync();
```

Completion and progress callbacks have no UI-thread affinity. Consumers that require a UI thread must marshal callbacks themselves. `AnalysisCompleted` is raised exactly once after success, validation failure, runtime failure, or cancellation; the returned task then propagates validation exceptions, runtime exceptions, and cancellation.

### 7.7 1D integration, LEC construction, and risk measures (v0.13, Phase 4)

Normative summary; full math and every legacy `file:line` in
[../technical-reference/risk-integration.md](../technical-reference/risk-integration.md) and
[../technical-reference/loss-exceedance-curves.md](../technical-reference/loss-exceedance-curves.md).

**Integrator.** Replace `AdaptiveSimpsonsRule` with `AdaptiveGaussKronrod` (G10K21) at both 1D call
sites — the per-component risk integral (legacy `RiskAnalysis.vb:2852-2889`) and the CVaR integral
over `[1e-16, α]` of the log-log LEC quantile (legacy `Curve.vb:547-552`). The surface is identical;
give the CVaR integral explicit tol/eval caps (legacy used library defaults). The integrator's
returned value is not the risk result — its adaptively placed evaluation points are recorded as
`RiskPoint`s, and the LECs are built from those. G10K21 nodes are strictly interior, so no two
adjacent stratification bins share a `p` (the risk-point set stays duplicate-free).

**`RiskIntegrand` — the refinement objective** (`Core.Enums`, a hashed `RiskAnalysisOptions` field;
per §4). It changes only where the adaptive integrator concentrates evaluations; all five risk-type
LECs and every risk measure are produced regardless of the choice. Members, integrands (functions of
the hazard non-exceedance probability `p`), and what each refines:

| Member | Integrand | Concentrates points where |
|---|---|---|
| `MeanTotalRisk` **(default)** | `P_F·E[C_F] + P_NF·C_NF` | v1.0 behavior; mean annualized total consequence |
| `MeanIncrementalRisk` | `P_F·E[(C_F − C_NF)⁺]` (Excess) | the reducible risk lives |
| `TotalProbabilityOfFailure` | `P_F(p)` | the fragility is steep; pairs with `RiskAnalysisMode.Reliability` |
| `TailConditionalRisk` | `P_F·E[C_F]·1{p ≤ α}`, α = `Options.Alpha` | the α-tail — VaR / CVaR / F-N tail |
| `ThresholdExceedanceProbability` | `P(C > ConsequenceThreshold ∣ p)` | the assurance / tolerable-risk decision |
| `SecondMoment` | `E[C² ∣ p]` | the LEC variance |
| `Balanced` | normalized sum of MeanTotalRisk + SecondMoment + TailConditionalRisk | every measure converges together; the sensible default for API callers reading all measures |

The last two integrands are discontinuous in `p`; inject the crossing (`p = α`, resp. the threshold)
as a stratification-bin boundary so it lands on a bin edge (the `Integrate(List<StratificationBin>)`
overload already supports this).

**LEC construction** (both 1D and system paths converge on one algorithm):
1. Probability mass is recorded, never re-derived. The 1D path integrates the natural probability support `[p_min, p_max]` with the acceptance-aware `AdaptiveGaussKronrod.Recorder`, then adds two endpoint rectangles: mass `p_min` at the lower supported hazard and residual mass `1 - compensated_sum(lower + interior)` at the upper supported hazard. The residual must agree with `1 - p_max` within a tight floating-point bound. Thus K accepted interior contributions become K+2 collectively exhaustive contributions without stretching or proportionally renormalizing the interior weights. The joint path records the realized VEGAS `wgt` values under its separately documented multi-pass normalization.
2. Build the exceedance curve exactly from sorted `(mass, consequence)` pairs using compensated accumulation. Output thinning repeatedly retains the original ordinate with the largest log-log interpolation error, preserving required anchors and breaking ties by original index. Means and moments always use the unthinned pairs.
3. Central moments use compensated weighted streaming accumulation, avoiding cancellation when the mean dominates the spread.
4. Exhaustive Total streams are an internal invariant: their raw recorded mass must be exactly one. Defective streams must remain in `[0,1]`. Non-finite, negative, or materially excessive mass faults the run. Singleton and degenerate distributions remain valid curves; no published property fabricates mass from a curve-kind flag.
**Risk-measure catalog** (all built from the finished LEC; defects fixed): `TotalProbability`
(= annualized P(failure) on the `Fail` curve), `Mean` (= EAD / mean annualized risk),
`ConditionalMean` (`Mean/TotalProbability`), `StandardDeviation`, `Skewness`, `Kurtosis`,
`ConsequenceThresholdProbability` (assurance), `HazardThresholdProbability`, `ValueAtRisk`,
`ConditionalValueAtRisk`, plus the `LEC` (F-N) and the `HazardFrequency` / `HazardvsCEN` profiles.
Two fixes: `ValueAtRisk` returns **0** (not the minimum consequence) when `α > TotalProbability`; and
the uncertainty percentile `Total` curve is read from the Total LEC, not reconstructed as
`fAEP + nfAEP` (legacy `RiskAnalysis.vb:3369`).

### 7.8 System risk aggregation (v0.13, Phase 4b)

> **Landed 2026-07-23 with the v0.15 implementation errata** (see the status log): the additive
> convolution is an exact lattice via `Fourier.FFT` (`SystemConvolution`; `EmpiricalDistribution.Convolve`
> cannot represent the zero atoms — N8 extended), the automatic γ target comes from a
> deterministic per-component quadrature probe (the warm-up harvest was unimplementable),
> recording accumulates five self-normalized passes, and the defective system stream
> probabilities keep the v1.0 system-state semantics. The text below is the v0.13 design intent;
> where it conflicts with the v0.15 items, v0.15 wins.

Full math in [../technical-reference/loss-exceedance-curves.md](../technical-reference/loss-exceedance-curves.md) §System aggregation.

**Additive method — strict independence + FFT convolution.** The additive method is **redefined to
assume components are strictly independent** (ratified). Validation: `SystemRiskMethod = Additive`
with `ComponentHazardDependency ≠ Independent` or a non-identity `HazardCorrelationMatrix` is an
**Error**; the correlation matrix applies to the joint method only. The v1.0 additive path combined
only the first two moments and produced **no system LEC** — v1.1 builds a true system LEC for all
five risk types by FFT:
- The `Fail`/`Excess`/`NonFail` curves are *defective* (`TotalProbability < 1`). Make each proper by
  adding an atom at consequence 0 with mass `1 − TotalProbability` (the "component did not fail ⇒
  contributes zero" branch). **Convolving the D zero-inflated distributions is exactly the
  enumeration of all 2^D component failure/non-failure combinations**, in O(n log n) rather than
  2^D, and reproduces the full tail rather than a conditional mean.
- Per risk type, build `EmpiricalDistribution(xValues, pValues)` from each component curve
  (X ascending consequence, P = 1 − exceedance) and call
  `EmpiricalDistribution.Convolve(IList<EmpiricalDistribution>, numberOfPoints)`. `Background` is
  already exhaustive; convolve component `Total` curves for the system `Total`.
- **Grid hazard:** `Convolve` samples PDFs on a *linear* grid over `[Σmin, Σmax]`. Life-loss ranges
  span orders of magnitude, so add option `SystemConvolutionPoints` (default 4096, min 4096); assert
  the convolved mean equals `Σ` component means to 1e-6 relative (this is the exact v1.0 additive
  answer — a free regression gate); gate the phase on a brute-force MC tail cross-check. Log-spaced
  convolution is Numerics item N8. System `pF = Probability.IndependentUnion(pfs)`.

**Joint method — Vegas power transform + real combination enumeration.**
- **Expose the power transform.** `RiskAnalysisOptions` gains `VegasTailFocusMode { None, Automatic,
  Manual }` (default `Automatic`) and `VegasTailFocusParameter` (γ, default 1.0 = v1.0-identical,
  valid [1, 20]). `None` pins γ = 1 for v1.0 comparability; `Manual` uses the supplied γ.
- **γ heuristic (`Automatic`).** Harvest `pTarget` from the warm-up pass (which already runs with
  `recordOutput = false` and currently discards everything but the grid): accumulate observed
  per-component failure probabilities, set `pTarget = clamp(min_i P̂_f,i · Alpha, 1e-12, 1e-2)`, then
  call `Vegas.ConfigureForRareEvents(pTarget)` before the recording pass. Zero extra cost,
  deterministic, adapts to actual fragility.
- **Jacobian audit.** In TotalRisk the Vegas `wgt` *is* the LEC probability mass, so the
  power-transform Jacobian must be folded into `wgt` or every LEC ordinate is biased even when the
  integral is correct. Verify (Numerics item N9) before enabling γ > 1 by default.
- **Record more than one final pass** — accumulate LEC points across `IndependentEvaluations > 1`
  recording passes and scale `FinalEvaluations` with D in `SetIntegrationDefaults` (a single 10,000-
  eval pass is far too sparse for a D-dimensional tail ordinate).
- **Enumerate real combinations.** Activate the parallel `ResponseProbabilities` /
  `FailureConsequences` / `ExcessConsequences` lists on `ComponentRiskOutput` (the legacy
  `ComponentRiskOutput.vb:39` TODO) so the Vegas integrand enumerates the true within-component
  consequence distribution instead of convolving per-component conditional means. Fix the
  double-increment of `tPF` (legacy `RiskAnalysis.vb:3117` and `:3129`).

### 7.9 Cascading end states — classification and non-failure branch semantics (Phase 6.7)

#### 7.9.1 Leaf algebra (v0.16 restated)

Each consequence terminal projects one failure mode = one **end state** `s` with stages
`i = 1..n_s`, per-stage sampled fragility `p_i(h_i)` (evaluated at stage *i*'s transformed signal)
and polarity `π_i ∈ {Fail, NonFail}` read from the exit port the path used. The state weight is the
polarity product `w_s(h) = ∏_i (π_i = Fail ? p_i : 1 − p_i)`. The **leaf signature**
`σ_s` = the ordered `(response-element occurrence ordinal, polarity)` pairs. Distinct-signature
terminals sharing their first response element form one **mutually-exclusive state group**
(within-group exact partition — signatures diverge at a shared response via opposite ports, so the
events are disjoint by construction and `Σ_s w_s ≤ 1`). Per the Phase 6.7 Q2 ruling
(user decision 2026-07-24): terminals with **identical** signatures or **prefix-nested** signatures
(a terminal and a continuation claiming the same branch) stay *legal*, leave the partition, and
combine as standalone units under the ambient `FailureModeMethod` (today's fan-out semantics) with
an advisory warning — the mass-balance witness surfaces the double-count honestly.

#### 7.9.2 Classification = final polarity

An end state is a **failure state** iff its *final* stage polarity is Fail; a NonFail-final
terminal is a **non-failure damage state**. Rationale: exact v1.0 parity generalized — the single
response's out-port was implicitly Fail and the hidden complement fell to the background mode; under
cascades the Fail-final leaves are the modeled adverse outcomes. Consequences: the component failure
union `U(h)` (APF, Fail stream, f-N, contribution) sums **failure states only**, so the breach
convention is preserved — wiring a partial-damage terminal (`R1-Fail → R2-NonFail`) never changes
APF (`U = p₁p₂` in the progression example, not `p₁`).

#### 7.9.3 Non-failure branch consequences — YES, directly wireable

A NonFail-port terminal is the direct wiring of non-failure consequences: it **claims its branch's
complement mass with its own consequence functions** (count/order matching the declared
consequence-type axis, like every terminal). Unwired NonFail mass falls back to the component's
background non-failure mode exactly as v1.0 implied. The response-free background path is unchanged
and remains the fallback; a component whose cascade claims its whole complement simply leaves the
background with zero residual mass.

#### 7.9.4 Excess pairing — the flipped-final-sibling counterfactual

A failure state's excess partner is the terminal whose signature equals its own **with the final
polarity flipped** (the exact "same scenario, but the last response held" counterfactual), when
wired: `R2-Fail` excess = `C_full − C_partial`. Otherwise (sibling unwired, or the NonFail branch
continues into further responses) the partner falls back to the background mode — v1.0 parity. The
partner's functions are sampled at the failure state's coupling percentile through the existing Q-N
machinery (`SampledFailureMode` already accepts any pairing mode); resolution happens once at the
`SetupSamplers` freeze. Non-failure damage states record no excess entries (excess is
failure-incremental by definition), and when neither sibling nor background exists the failure
state pairs against a zero baseline as today.

#### 7.9.5 Complement decomposition — single-claiming-group scope

At hazard `h`: `U(h)` = the across-group combined failure union (existing math);
`C(h) = 1 − U(h)` = the complement. A claimed non-failure state `s′` in group `g` records the
conditional mass

`m_{s′}(h) = C(h) · w_{s′}(h) / (1 − P_g(h))`,   `P_g = Σ_{s ∈ g, failure} w_s`

— exact under independent groups, adopted as the documented convention under ME/CCA/dependency.
With a single group this collapses to `m ≡ w` exactly. Failure pathways carry failure consequences
only (v1.0 parity — claimed non-failure damages record against the no-failure complement, never
inside another group's failure event). The remainder `C − Σ m ≥ 0` carries the background
consequences (zero-consequence when no background path exists, as today), keeping the Total stream
exhaustive at 1. **Scope restriction (deliberate):** claimed non-failure states are allowed in at
most **one** group per component — with two claiming groups the conditional masses require a
cross-product of per-group complement states plus a non-failure consequence-combination rule, and
the additive shortcut can drive the remainder negative. Validation errors on a second claiming
group; the cross-product generalization is the documented lift.

#### 7.9.6 Across-group combination and the narrow Competing gate

The `FailureModeMethod` operates on the group failure-mass vector `{P_g}` (v0.16): Joint pathway
decomposition (dependency/`ExclusivePCM`/MVN and the correlation matrix at **group** dimension), ME
normalization, CCA factor — a participating group distributes its failure states conditionally
(`w_s / P_g`), so joint entries are cross products of state entries and all Σ-identities
(contribution, mass balance) stay exact. **Competing** is legal iff every failure state in every
multi-state group has an all-Fail signature: a product of non-decreasing fragilities is
non-decreasing, so the group CIF curves construct (the same monotone-transform assumption
single-stage Competing already makes). A failure state riding a NonFail branch (else-chain,
`(1 − p₁)p₂` — rises then falls) makes the group mass non-monotone and errors under Competing; the
telescoping-union relaxation (claimed leaf sets whose union is an increasing event, e.g.
`{R1F} ∪ {R1NF, R2F} = 1 − (1−p₁)(1−p₂)`) is documented, not implemented.

#### 7.9.7 Validation rules (polarity-aware)

Continuations are legal on **either** port (progression chains and else-chains). Errors: a response
element with no downstream consumer at all (today's leaf rule); a second claiming group (§7.9.5);
Competing with a NonFail-branch failure state (§7.9.6); correlation-matrix dimension ≠ group count.
Warnings: duplicate/prefix-nested leaf signatures (Q2); a response element whose **Fail** port has
no downstream path to any terminal (its failure mass silently joins the background remainder — 
almost always a modeling surprise; the unwired **NonFail** port stays silent, being the v1.0
default); shared response element across distinct groups (draw-sharing advisory). Reliability mode:
NonFail-final terminals are inert (consequence-free) and stay silent.

#### 7.9.8 Worked examples

**Progression / partial damage** (`H → R1 → R2`; `R2-Fail → C_full`, `R2-NonFail → C_partial`;
background path `C_bg`). At `h` with `p₁ = 0.10`, `p₂ = 0.60`: failure state `w_full = 0.06`;
claimed state `w_partial = 0.04`; `U = 0.06`, `C = 0.94`; `m_partial = 0.94 · 0.04 / 0.94 = 0.04`
(single-group exactness); remainder `= 0.90 = 1 − p₁` → `C_bg`. Excess of the full-breach state
= `C_full − C_partial` (flipped-final sibling); APF integrand `= p₁p₂ = 0.06`. Wiring `C_partial`
changed no failure measure — it moved `0.04` of complement mass from background to partial-damage
consequences and sharpened the counterfactual.

**Else-chain** (`R1-Fail → C₁`; `R1-NonFail → R2`; `R2-Fail → C₂`; `R2-NonFail` unwired). Same
numbers: failure states `w₁ = 0.10`, `w₂ = 0.90 · 0.60 = 0.54`; `U = 0.64`; remainder
`C = 0.36 = (1−p₁)(1−p₂)` → background. Both states pair against background (no flipped-final
siblings wired). Joint/ME/CCA legal; Competing errors (`w₂` is non-monotone).

**v1-style explicit non-failure wiring** (`R1-Fail → C_f`, `R1-NonFail → C_nf`, no background
path): `U = p₁`, claimed `m = 1 − p₁`, remainder 0 — the background path becomes optional; excess
= `C_f − C_nf` branch-paired.

#### 7.9.9 Deliberately deferred

Multi-group claimed non-failure states (cross-product complement + a non-failure combination rule);
Competing over else-chain failure states (telescoping-union monotonicity analysis); state-level
cross-group `ExclusivePCM` coupling (the Gaussian copula couples group failure indicators only);
numeric `InverseSRP` for cascades (no engine consumer exists).

## 8. Layer boundaries & consumer contract

**v0.11 (2026-07-20).** Normative for every consumer of `RMC.TotalRisk.dll`: the future
`RMC.TotalRisk.UI` element/persistence layer, the `RMC-TotalRisk` App, `RMC.TotalRisk.Api`, and
headless/agentic callers. The shape follows `RMC.BestFit`, whose model → UI → App split is the
in-house precedent this library is meant to slot into.

### 8.1 What owns what

| Concept | Owned by | Persisted as |
|---|---|---|
| Input functions (`TabularHazard`, `TabularResponse`, …) | The **consuming layer**, one stored item each | Its own row; the function's `ToXElement()` in one column |
| `SystemComponent` (graph + options) | Its owning **`RiskAnalysis`** — components are *not* independently creatable in the UI/App | A column on the analysis's row, functions written `ByReference` |
| `RiskAnalysis` config | Itself | `RiskAnalysis.ToXElement()` — **options and `IsEstimated` only** |
| Results | Themselves | Separate columns; JSON (per v0.8 §4) |

The analysis rule is BestFit's, verbatim: `UnivariateAnalysis.ToXElement()` writes config only and
documents that it excludes the underlying model and the computed results; the model is stored in
its own column and comes back through `new UnivariateAnalysis(dist, xElement, mcmcResults, …)`.
`RiskAnalysis` will follow that constructor shape — components and results in, config from XML.
This is what lets a single component be shared across the alternatives of a
`CostBenefitAnalysis`, and what keeps the analysis blob from becoming an all-in-one document.

### 8.2 Referencing functions: `Id`, not name

`IRiskFunction.Id` (a `Guid`) is the persistent reference key. It is serialized and **stripped by
`CanonicalizationRules.ModelRules`**, so identity can never perturb content or a seed.
`AssignNewId()` is what a "duplicate this function" flow calls; a deep copy keeps the id, because
a copy is the same logical function.

BestFit references elements by **name**, resolved by linear scan with defensive type checks — its
own retrospective flags this as the thing to reconsider, since a rename or a name collision can
silently re-resolve to a different type. The shared framework's `NodeBase.NodeGuid` is the
counter-example, and `IRiskElement.Id` already followed it. Names remain serialized alongside ids
as a lenient fallback for hand-authored and legacy forms.

### 8.3 The two serialization modes

`RiskSerializationMode` governs how a graph writes the functions its elements wrap:

- **`SelfContained`** (the default; the no-arg `ToXElement()` delegates to it) — function content
  inline. The form stands alone. Headless callers, verification oracles, and the REST/MCP API use
  this and are unaffected by anything in this section.
- **`ByReference`** — each wrapped function becomes a `<FunctionReference Id="…" Name="…"/>`.
  Reading such a form requires an `IRiskFunctionResolver`, which **must return the live stored
  instance, not a copy**. That is the entire point: a graph and the store it was loaded from
  observe the same object, so an edit in one is seen in the other.

`IRiskFunctionResolver` mirrors `RiskElementResolver` exactly — an id is authoritative and throws
when stale (a dangling persistent reference means the stored form is inconsistent); a name-only
reference is lenient and surfaces through validation as an unresolved reference naming it, which is
deliberately distinguished from "no function assigned".

**Invariant (tested):** the mode cannot move a canonical hash. `SystemComponent.CanonicalHash()`
hashes the projected `FailureMode` XML, and `FailureMode`/`ResponseStage` always serialize their
functions inline regardless of mode. A component seeds identically however it was stored — if this
ever breaks, a project's Monte Carlo results would depend on how the project was saved.

### 8.4 Change propagation

Elements subscribe to their wrapped functions' `PropertyChanged` and re-raise it; `ComponentGraph`
forwards element changes; `SystemComponent` subscribes to its graph. So an edit made where a
function is stored reaches the analyses that consume it, and a consuming layer can invalidate
stale results — the role `UnivariateAnalysis.Model_PropertyChanged` plays in BestFit.

Ordered collections of model objects are `ObservableCollection<T>`, and their owner reconciles
per-item subscriptions on every membership change — `ConsequenceElement.Functions` follows the
sibling BestFit `CompositeAnalysis.Analyses` pattern exactly. Reconciliation is against a shadow
set of what is currently subscribed, **not** against the event's `OldItems`/`NewItems`, because
`Clear()` raises a Reset that carries no removed items; handling only the event payload leaks a
subscription on every clear. This also makes a duplicated entry subscribe once, so it notifies
once. WPF binds these collections directly.

### 8.5 Authoring surface for a graph editor

The DAG control wires nodes and hands the model layer the inner `IRiskFunction`s. It should use:

- `RiskElementFactory.CreateForFunction(function)` / `Create(RiskElementType)` — never its own
  cluster→element mapping, which is the mapping most likely to drift as clusters land.
- `IRiskElement.TryAssignFunction(function, out error)` — reports a cluster mismatch instead of
  throwing, because dropping the wrong function on a node is ordinary user error.
- `ComponentGraph.GetUniqueName` / `TryRenameElement` — the name authority.
- `ComponentGraph.GetAvailableHazardSources(element)` — the binding picker, reused by validation
  so picker and validator agree by construction.
- `SystemComponent.GetReferencedFunctions()` — the save-time dependency set, and the answer to
  "this function is used by N components — delete anyway?".

Canvas position lives on the element (`LeftPosition`/`TopPosition`, stripped from hashing), so the
editor needs no parallel layout store.

### 8.6 What the model library still refuses

Unchanged from §2: no WPF, no `System.Windows.*`, no SQLite, no file I/O, no `RMC.BestFit`
reference, no DAG.dll. `IElement` and the wrapper vocabulary stay in the UI layer; the model layer
speaks `IRiskElement`. A user must be able to build a system and run an analysis from the model
library alone — asserted by a model-only end-to-end test with no store, no resolver, and no
consuming layer in the call path.

v0.6: `RMC.TotalRisk.dll` references **Numerics only** — the same red line Hydrologics enforces. BestFit fitted results arrive as *data* (Numerics artifacts), not through a DLL reference; see [SHARED_FUNCTIONS_STRATEGY.md](SHARED_FUNCTIONS_STRATEGY.md) §5.

## 10. Migration plan

> **v0.8: SUPERSEDED by [../ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md)** — the ratified phase order is: 1 kernel foundation → 2 core input functions (tabular ×4 + parametric hazard/response + non-fail) → 3 components + JSON results → 4 analysis foundation + engine + ReliabilityAnalysis → 5–6 verification → 7–13 backfill (closed-form functions, Numerics expansion, composites, event trees, bivariate/BestFit/LifeSim, hardening, release) → 14 REST API + MCP server. The sub-phase text below is retained for its per-cluster task detail only; where it conflicts with ROADMAP.md or the v0.8 status entry, those win.

Original (v0.6) order notes follow.

### Phase 2.0 — Numerics.Functions expansion (v0.6; prerequisite)

Executed in the `C:\GIT\numerics` repo (branch `bug-fixes-and-enhancements`); full work plan in [SHARED_FUNCTIONS_STRATEGY.md](SHARED_FUNCTIONS_STRATEGY.md) §4:

- N1 — `UnivariateFunctionType` enum + `ToXElement()` on `IUnivariateFunction` and all concretes + `UnivariateFunctionFactory` (mirrors the existing `LinkFunctionFactory`).
- N2 — `SegmentedPowerFunction` (BestFit BaRatin rating-curve form; `ParameterSet`-compatible parameter layout).
- N3 — `CompositeFunction` (weighted-average + mixture modes).
- N4 — `EnsembleFunction` posterior sampling (pure `Sample(int)` / `Sample(double)` — thread-safe).
- N5 — `EmpiricalDistribution` XElement round-trip fix (+ `KernelDensity` check).
- N6/N7 — tests + `docs/functions/` guide page; release `RMC.Numerics 2.2.0` to the local feed.
- TotalRisk consumes via sibling `<HintPath>` until 2.2.0 ships, then switches to the PackageReference.

### Phase 2.1 — Hazard cluster (cluster #1)

Includes the v1.1.0 expansion to bivariate hazards. Larger than the legacy port alone.

- ~~Add `RMC.BestFit.dll` reference to `RMC.TotalRisk.csproj`.~~ **v0.6: no BestFit reference.** `BestFit*` types are posterior-import types constructed from already-parsed Numerics artifacts (`UncertaintyAnalysisResults`, `ParameterSet[]`, marginals + copula, X/Y/Z arrays).
- Port and rename Support types: `IHazardFunction`, `IUnivariateHazardFunction`, `IBivariateHazardFunction`, `HazardFunctionBase`, `UnivariateHazardBase`, `BivariateHazardBase`, `WeightedHazardFunction`.
- Port 6 univariate types: `ParametricUnivariateHazard`, `BestFitUnivariateHazard`, `NonparametricHazard`, `TabularHazard`, `RFAHazard`, `CompositeHazard`.
- Add 3 bivariate types: `ParametricBivariateHazard`, `BestFitBivariateHazard`, `BestFitTabularHazard`.
- `BestFitUnivariateHazard` extended to import any analysis from `RMC.BestFit.Analyses.Univariate.*`.
- `CanonicalizationRules` entries + hash-invariance tests on each, matching §5.5.3.
- Unit tests per concrete: XElement round-trip, `Validate()`, `SampleFunction()` smoke, bivariate `SampleConditionalYGivenX` smoke.
- ≥1 MC parity test reproducing a legacy `Test_TotalRisk` univariate hazard scenario within tolerance.
- ≥1 MC parity test cross-checking a `BestFitTabularHazard` against a directly-computed coincident-frequency analysis.
- DoD: `dotnet build` clean (0 warnings), all tests pass.

### Phase 2.2 — Transform cluster

Small after Phase 2.0 — the types are thin wrappers over `Numerics.Functions` (§6.2).

- Port `ITransformFunction`, `TransformFunctionBase`, `WeightedTransformFunction`.
- Port 3 existing types: `LinearTransform`, `PowerTransform`, `TabularTransform`.
- Add 2 new types: `CompositeTransform`, `BestFitTransform` (`SegmentedPowerFunction` + posterior import).
- `CanonicalizationRules` entries + hash-invariance tests on each.
- Unit tests + parity tests.

### Phase 2.3 — Response cluster

- Port `IResponseFunction`, `ResponseFunctionBase`, `WeightedResponseFunction`.
- Port the ordinary response types in their owning phases; implement the tree-response foundation and event hierarchy in Phase 10A and static fault hierarchy in Phase 10B.
- Extend `BivariateResponse` with bivariate hazard wiring (`PrimaryHazardType`, `SecondaryHazardType`, alignment validation against parent component).
- Do not add a fault-tree placeholder. Implement the approved exact design in Phase 10B after the Phase 10A foundation exits.
- Add projected canonical identities and hash-invariance tests according to the normative tree-response design; persistent child order is never allowed to leak metadata into compute identity.
- Unit tests + parity tests, including a bivariate-response + bivariate-hazard end-to-end scenario.

### Phase 2.4 — Consequence cluster

- Port `IConsequenceFunction`, `ConsequenceFunctionBase`, `WeightedConsequenceFunction`, `LifeSimResult`.
- Port 3 existing types: `TabularConsequence`, `LifeSimConsequence`, `CompositeConsequence`.
- Add 1 new type: `ParametricConsequence` (power form per ER 1110-2-1156; landed pre-Phase-4, 2026-07-21, along with `CompositeConsequence` + `WeightedConsequenceFunction`).
- `CanonicalizationRules` entries + hash-invariance tests on each.
- Unit tests + parity tests.

### Phase 2.5 — Risk Analysis engine + supporting
- Port `Analyses/Support/` (`IAnalysis`, `AnalysisBase`, `AnalysisRunCompletedEventArgs`).
- Port `Models/RiskAnalysis/Components/` (`SystemComponent`, `FailureMode`, `SampledComponent`, `SampledFailureMode`, `ComponentRiskOutput`, enums).
- Port `Models/RiskAnalysis/Results/` (`Curve`, `Curves`, `RiskPoint`, `Ensemble`, `*Realization`, `*Results`).
- Port `Analyses/RiskAnalysis/RiskAnalysis.cs` — wire content-based seeding, `Parallel.For` MC loop, `RunAsync` lifecycle.
- Strip `[Serializable]` + `BinaryFormatter`; XElement round-trip for `SystemRealization` / `EnsembleResults`.
- **Drop `RiskDiagram` entirely** (UI concern; future Phase 3).
- **Drop all `Project.GetInstance()` references**; pass instances directly.
- ≥3 MC parity tests covering AdditiveRisk + JointRisk + EstimateMeanRiskOnly.
- 1 bivariate end-to-end parity test: a component with a `ParametricBivariateHazard`, two FMs (one bound to Primary, one to Secondary), and a `BivariateResponse` on a third FM with `ConsequenceHazardBinding` set. Verify nested integration produces expected joint-risk profile.
- 1 reproducibility regression test asserting that a `SystemComponent` graph with shuffled order produces bit-identical results vs. canonical order (proves the v1 bug fix).
- 1 LHS variance-reduction test: same scenario at N=1000 with `MonteCarlo` vs. `LatinHypercube` across 50 repeated runs; LHS empirical standard error of LEC mean is ≥3× lower than MC (loose threshold to avoid flakiness; expected reduction is 10×+).
- 1 LHS K-count assertion: `CountKnowledgeUncertaintyDimensions()` matches actual `PercentileQueue` consumption across all parity scenarios (Debug.Assert in code; explicit unit test ensures no off-by-one in any cluster's port).

### Phase 2.6 — Cleanup
- Retire `BuildInfo.cs` smoke seed + its `InternalsVisibleTo` declaration.
- Fix `RMC.TotalRisk.IO.csproj` `<AssemblyName>` collision (remove the override; let it default to `RMC.TotalRisk.IO`).
- Update [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) to reflect actual port order.
- Append the Phase 2 decision log to the Dev repo's root `MEMORY.md`.

### Definition of done (whole Phase 2)

Per ROADMAP §Phase 2:
- Every pure-compute class in the triage table is in `RMC.TotalRisk` with full XML docs, test coverage in `.Tests`, and parity coverage in `.Verification`.
- `RMC.TotalRisk.Tests` ≥90% line coverage on `RMC.TotalRisk.dll`.
- `dotnet build RMC.TotalRisk.csproj` succeeds on Linux (one-off container check; proves no Windows-only dep leaked in).

Plus added by this architecture:
- v1 reproducibility-bug regression test passes for every cluster's parity scenario (shuffle/rename/reorder all reproduce bit-identical results).

Living section. Append entries as we go. Once an item is resolved, move it under `## Resolved` with the resolution date.

### Open

> Phase references of the form "Phase 2.x" below predate the 2026-07-20 roadmap reorder; see [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) for the current numbering.

- **Q-D**: `LifeSimConsequence` is a heavy type that wraps a separate simulation. Audit during Phase 2.4: confirm there's no hidden file I/O in its compute path.
- **Q-E**: Threading audit — `Parallel.For` is straightforward, but are any `SampledComponent` / `SampledFailureMode` operations not thread-safe today? Audit during Phase 2.5.
- **Q-F**: `BasicMessageItem` rich metadata — Phase 2 drops severity/code/source/property-name. If the future REST API or agentic clients need structured error codes, revisit this in v1.x with a `ValidationIssue` record.
- **Q-H**: Numerics's `Random.NextIntegers(int)` — confirm it's part of public `Numerics.Utilities` API; if not, inline equivalent.
- **Q-J** *(answered for the consequence composite 2026-07-21)*: Should the `OccurrenceIndex` ALSO be applied within composites (e.g., a `CompositeHazard` containing two identical sub-hazards with different weights)? `CompositeConsequence.SetupSampler` answers it structurally: each child's seed is `HashCombine(seed, child.CanonicalHash(), ordinal)`, so identical-content siblings get independent draws from the list ordinal — no occurrence-index machinery and no dependence on distinguishing weights (pinned by test: two identical-content children draw independently). `CompositeHazard`/`CompositeResponse` adopt the same recipe in Phase 9.
- **Q-M**: Bootstrap posterior size vs. Realizations count. `ParametricHazard.SampleFunction(int idx)` looks up the idx-th posterior parameter set. The legacy bootstrap stores M ∈ [100, 100000] samples; risk analysis runs N ∈ [1000, 10000+] realizations. If M < N, indices currently wrap modularly. Two options: keep the index-based path (simpler, parity with legacy) or convert to a `SamplingDimensions = 1` percentile-based path (`posterior[(int)(p * M)]`) so the bootstrap participates in LHS. Decide during Phase 2.1; for the initial port, preserve index-based.
- **Q-P**: `BestFitTabularHazard` import shape. BestFit's `CoincidentFrequencyAnalysis` produces an X × Y × Z table with MCMC sample bounds. Decide what gets stored in canonical hash: the full Z[i,j] grid, or a compressed posterior-summary representation. Affects file size on save and canonical-hash bytes; doesn't affect math. Resolve during Phase 2.1.
- **Q-Q**: Copula sampling under LHS for `ParametricBivariateHazard`. The copula's parameter uncertainty (if present) needs to be one LHS dimension; the marginals each have their own. `SamplingDimensions` for a parametric bivariate hazard is `MarginalX.SamplingDimensions + MarginalY.SamplingDimensions + (copula uncertain ? 1 : 0)`. Confirm during Phase 2.1.
- **Q-R**: `BivariateResponse` surface uncertainty. The existing legacy `BivariateResponse` is deterministic (D=0 per the explore agent's report). For v1.1.0, do we add knowledge uncertainty on the surface itself (e.g., uncertainty per surface ordinate)? Default proposal: keep deterministic for the initial port; revisit in v2 if users request it. Tracked.
- **Q-S** *(added 2026-07-19)*: Phase 2.0 design details tracked in [SHARED_FUNCTIONS_STRATEGY.md](SHARED_FUNCTIONS_STRATEGY.md) §9: `SegmentedPowerFunction` parameter-layout verification vs BestFit `RatingCurve.cs` (S-1); `EnsembleFunction` index-wrap/percentile policy (S-2 — interacts with Q-M for imported posteriors); `KernelDensity` round-trip (S-3); `CanonicalContentHasher` upstreaming to `Numerics.Utilities` (S-4); `UncertainOrderedPairedData` extension needs (S-5).

### Resolved

- **Q-B / Q-O** *(resolved 2026-07-28, v0.21)*: The complete tree-response design is [EVENT_AND_FAULT_TREE_RESPONSE_DESIGN.md](EVENT_AND_FAULT_TREE_RESPONSE_DESIGN.md). Canonical identity uses projected topology and target content rather than names/IDs; mathematically commutative fault inputs sort canonically while stable branch IDs preserve event-tree output connections. Event trees compile independent links and propagate conditional mass in linear time. Static fault trees distinguish shared logical events from independent clones and use an exact ROBDD; cut sets are inspection only. Both recursively participate in LHS and produce conditional fragility, leaving hazard frequency and risk to the existing function/graph/analysis layers.

- **Q-X** *(added 2026-07-22, v0.14; successor design ratified 2026-07-23, v0.16; **RESOLVED 2026-07-24, v0.18 — Phase 6.7 landed**)*: Multi-stage response composition semantics. The Phase-3 grammar `T* (R T*)* C` authors chains with two or more response stages, but v1.0 had exactly one response and no oracle covered composition. The v0.14 deferral (the `RiskAnalysis.Validate()` gate + the `SampledFailureMode` constructor throw) is replaced by the implemented cascading-response-end-states design: typed Fail/Non-Fail output ports, per-stage `BranchPolarity` (polarity-product SRP), end states as projected modes in mutually-exclusive state groups with the complement remainder to background, final-polarity classification (§7.9.2), the claimed-complement mixture (§7.9.5), sibling excess pairing (§7.9.4), and the across-unit combination with the narrow competing gate (§7.9.6). See the v0.18 status block and §7.9; evidence in `CascadeEndStateVerification`.
- **Q-Y** *(added and **RESOLVED 2026-07-25, v0.19** — Phase 9 partial landing)*: **Are composite mixture weights aleatory or epistemic?** A weighted list of children admits two readings — the weights are frequencies within the event population (aleatory), or they are credibility that one fixed-but-unknown alternative is correct (epistemic). The two share a mean and differ in spread, so the choice is invisible in expected risk and decisive in the uncertainty bands. **Ratified: v1.1 implements the aleatory reading only**, because aleatory representability differs by cluster and only three of four clusters can express it. Hazard and response composites return a real `Numerics.Mixture` distribution built from the children sampled at the same realization, so `SamplingDimensions` is 0 and no branch is ever selected — a realization *is already a distribution*, the mixture folds into it losslessly, and the Q-V tail defect cannot arise. `CompositeConsequence` is aleatory by ratified Q-V (exposure branches). `CompositeTransform` **cannot** represent an aleatory mixture at all — `SampledFailureMode` chains transforms deterministically, with no branch surface — so it ships `Average` only, and `Mixture` is a validation error until the engine gains a transform analog of exposure branches. Consequences: a mixture of deterministic hazard/response children is itself deterministic (the divergence from `CompositeConsequence`); an epistemic mode for any cluster is deferred to its own ratification, with the practitioner decision rule and the Jensen-bias worked example already written up in `docs/technical-reference/composite-functions.md`. Evidence in `CompositeHazardVerification`, `CompositeResponseVerification`, and `CompositeTransformVerification`.
- **Q-Z** *(added 2026-07-25, v0.19; **resolved upstream 2026-07-26 — N12**)*: **`BootstrapAnalysis.Estimate()` was not bit-reproducible across calls.** Its summary assembly uses a parallel, order-nondeterministic reduction, so two `Estimate()` calls on a parametric function with identical inputs and an identical `PRNGSeed` agree numerically (≤ 1e-6 on every sampled quantile) but not bit-for-bit. The posterior is serialized content, so **any container that folds a child hash — a composite, a `SystemComponent` — has an unstable canonical hash across estimation runs**, and therefore unstable derived child seeds. Round-tripping through XML carries the posterior verbatim and is stable, which is what a stored project does, so the Phase 9 reproducibility pins round-trip rather than re-estimate. Same root cause as the documented `NonparametricHazard` mean-assembly nondeterminism. Resolved upstream by the N12 fixed-chunk deterministic reductions: two estimation runs with identical inputs and an identical `PRNGSeed` now agree bit-for-bit, pinned by `CompositeHazardVerification.Test_UpstreamEstimation_IsBitReproducible`; estimated parametric functions stay out of byte-gate fixtures as a defensive convention.

- **Q-K**: ~~Refactor `EventTreeResponse` to consume k percentiles…~~ **Resolved 2026-04-30**: incorporated into §5.8.6. Event trees are LHS-driven from day one of the Phase 2.3 port.
- **Q-L**: Default value of `RiskAnalysisOptions.SamplingScheme` — `LatinHypercube` (proposed; gives the variance-reduction win out of the box) vs. `MonteCarlo` (legacy parity, opt-in). Recommended `LatinHypercube`. **Resolved in implementation: `LatinHypercube` shipped as the default**, with the Phase 6 LHS variance-reduction family as the evidence.
- **Q-I** *(failure-mode half resolved 2026-07-20, v0.9; consequence-composite half resolved 2026-07-21)*: Failure-mode order within a component is **always declared order** — now grounded structurally: projected FM order is the consequence-element order in the graph's `Elements` list, which is serialized, canvas-free, and user-controllable; reordering terminals is a deliberate semantic edit (pinned by test). `CompositeConsequence` resolves its half the same way: **declared entry order is semantic** — it drives the child sampler ordinals and the hashed entry order, so reordering entries is a compute edit (pinned by test). `CompositeHazard`/`CompositeResponse` followed the same rule at their Phase 9 landing.
- **Q-N** *(amended 2026-07-20, v0.9)*: Fail vs. non-fail consequence coupling. Legacy `SampledFailureMode` draws ONE percentile r per realization and uses it for BOTH the failure consequence and a parallel sample of the parent non-failure consequence on the same FM, so excess = fail − non-fail is sampled coherently at the realization level. With per-function `SetupSampler`, fail and non-fail samplers are independent by default — the coupling is lost. Default proposal: have `FailureMode.SetupSamplers` allocate one shared consequence percentile that drives both functions via `SampleFunction(double percentile)` instead of `SampleFunction(int idx)`. v0.9 amendment: under multi-consequence lists the coupling applies **per paired position** (the k-th failure consequence shares its draw with the k-th non-failure consequence — pairing is positional). Design with the engine phase's sampled machinery. **RESOLVED 2026-07-22, v0.14**: the technical reference grounds the shared draw (C_F and C_NF perfectly correlated within a mode); landed as the failure mode's N×max(K,1) coupling matrix driving both sides of each positional pair through `SampleExposureBranches(double percentile)` — consequence functions are excluded from the per-function sampler walk (see the v0.14 status block, item 2).
- **Q-V** *(added 2026-07-21, v0.13; **RESOLVED 2026-07-22, v0.14 — ratified YES**)*: mixture-branch exposure enumeration applies in the full-MC path too. Mixture weights are aleatory exposure, so every realization's LEC carries the mixture spread and the ensemble stays purely epistemic. Landed: `SampledFailureMode` is branch-aware in both paths, `CompositeConsequence.SamplingDimensions` is 0, and the standalone per-realization mixture surface keeps its pre-Q-V stream through an internal selector matrix (see the v0.14 status block, item 1).
- **Q-U** *(added 2026-07-20, v0.9; **RESOLVED 2026-07-23, v0.16**)*: Engine semantics of `MultipleConsequences` under response fan-out. The projection sets the flag when a path's last response feeds ≥ 2 terminals (each terminal still projects its own failure mode). **Interim ratified 2026-07-22 (v0.14)**: risk math and LECs consumed the primary consequence (`ConsequenceFunctions[0]`) only. **Resolution (v0.16, Phase 6.5)**: the consequence-type axis is declared at the analysis level and every declared type computes through one engine pass — per-type Q-N coupling columns, shared probability structure, primary-driven refinement, per-type result containers at every scope (see the v0.16 status block). Fan-out terminals sharing one response instance already share its sampled draw (one instance = one knowledge quantity), and the ratified cascade design (Phase 6.7) gives fanned terminals their full end-state semantics.
- **Q-T** *(added 2026-07-20, v0.9; **RESOLVED 2026-07-24, v0.17**)*: `ProfileHazardFunction` shape. In v1.0 it is a results-reporting selector typed `IElement` (the primary hazard or any transform point) driving risk profiles and the assurance threshold. **Deferral ratified 2026-07-22 (v0.14)**: the profile remap and the legacy `Sensitivity()` surface both moved to the risk-diagnostics session. **Resolution (v0.17, Phase 6.6)**: an element reference on the component — `SystemComponent.ProfileHazardElementId` (`Guid?`, null = driving axis), valid only for a transform element in the component's own graph on an unbroken upstream path from the hazard element, resolved at the `SetupSamplers` freeze into a runtime-only sampled chain remapping every recorded hazard coordinate (profiles, extents, `HazardThresholdProbability`, the mode-scope pass-down, and `HazardLevelSensitivity`'s input axis). **Seed-inert by ratified decision** — serialized append-only, excluded from the identity form; the asymmetry with the hashed `HazardThreshold` is deliberate (threshold = compute, axis = presentation). The SRP profile plots against hazard exceedance probability rather than any hazard axis (see the v0.17 status block).
- **Q-W** *(added 2026-07-21, v0.13; narrowed 2026-07-23, v0.16; **RESOLVED 2026-07-24, v0.17 — design recorded, implementation deliberately withheld**)*: *Shared exposure state* across consequence types. In reality a single day/night draw should drive **all** consequence types on that mode at once (economic and life loss share the same exposure state); v1.0 has no concept of this. **v0.16 erratum**: the engine computes per-type marginal results and never crosses branches across types, so the question is moot for every output produced today. **Resolution (v0.17, Phase 6.6)**: the practical surface shipped as per-type marginals plus the per-type `ConsequenceThreshold` on `ConsequenceTypeDescriptor`; the shared-exposure declaration itself is sketched in §6.4.1 (a per-mode append-only flag binding one branch selector across the mode's consequence positions) and is implemented only when cross-type joint statistics — which do not exist in any produced output — are actually requested.
- **Q-G** *(resolved 2026-07-20, v0.9)*: `CorrelationMatrix` serializes and hashes the **full matrix, row-major** (G17; rows `;`-separated, values `,`-separated), and only under `DependencyType.CorrelationMatrix` — the automatic modes derive their matrices and never persist them (a lazily built MVN could otherwise perturb the hash). v1.0's braced format is not read: its parse loop discarded every value, so no legacy file ever round-tripped a matrix.
- **Q-A** *(resolved 2026-07-19, v0.6)*: Ordinate-distribution hashing. Under XML canonicalization each ordinate's Y-distribution serializes via Numerics `UnivariateDistributionBase.ToXElement()`, which carries the stable `Type` attribute (`UnivariateDistributionType` enum — confirmed present and append-only in Numerics). No separate tag table needed.
- **Q-C** *(resolved 2026-07-19, v0.6)*: `UncertaintyAnalysisResults` is a **Numerics** type with `ToXElement()` / `FromXElement` (plus JSON `ToByteArray`/`FromByteArray`); BestFit already persists results through exactly these methods in dedicated `.rmcbf` columns (`AnalysisPersistenceHelper`). No adapter needed — and no `RMC.BestFit.dll` reference at all (v0.6, strategy D2).

## Appendix A — Canonicalization rules (v0.6)

*(Replaces the v0.5 type-tag enum — under XML canonicalization the `ToXElement()` element name serves as the type tag.)*

The audited strip-rule set lives in `Models/Support/CanonicalizationRules.cs`; the hasher in `Models/Support/CanonicalContentHasher.cs`. Both adapt `C:\GIT\Hydrologics\src\Hydrologics\Core\CanonicalContentHasher.cs` / `CanonicalizationRules.cs`.

```csharp
namespace RMC.TotalRisk.Core
{
    public sealed class CanonicalizationRules
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// The audited rule set (v0.8 name: ModelRules) — identity, display, and presentation
        /// metadata that must never perturb Monte Carlo seeds. APPEND-ONLY: every new
        /// non-compute property lands here AND in the kitchen-sink invariance test.
        /// </summary>
        public static CanonicalizationRules ModelRules { get; } = new(
            strippedAttributes: new[]
            {
                "Name", "Description", "NameOnDisk", "Guid",
                "LeftPosition", "TopPosition",
                "SpecifiedHazard", "HazardUnit", "TransformedHazard", "TransformedHazardUnit",
                "SpecifiedConsequence", "ConsequenceUnit",
                "ChartSettings",
            },
            strippedElements: Array.Empty<string>(),
            rewriters: Array.Empty<Action<XElement>>());
    }
}
```

`CanonicalContentHasher.Hash(XElement, CanonicalRuleSet)` strips per the rules, encodes the surviving tree with an injective length-prefixed binary encoding (attributes ordinally sorted; owned-child order preserved as semantic), and returns the SHA-256 digest.

Landing checklist for every new model property (the Hydrologics pattern):

1. Classify: compute-relevant (stays in the hash) vs metadata (add to `ModelElementRules`).
2. Extend the kitchen-sink rename/reorder invariance test in `RMC.TotalRisk.Tests`.
3. Never rename or reorder existing serialized attributes/children — hashes are contract.

## Appendix B — Seed helper types (semantics unchanged from v0.5)

The occurrence-index seed derivation of §5.5.4 is untouched by the v0.6 hashing-mechanism change.

```csharp
// In Models/Support/SeedHelpers.cs
public static class SeedHelpers
{
    public static int HashCombine(int globalSeed, byte[] componentHash, int occurrenceIndex)
    {
        Span<byte> tail = stackalloc byte[8];
        BinaryPrimitives.WriteInt32LittleEndian(tail[..4], globalSeed);
        BinaryPrimitives.WriteInt32LittleEndian(tail[4..], occurrenceIndex);
        using var sha = SHA256.Create();
        sha.TransformBlock(tail.ToArray(), 0, 8, null, 0);
        sha.TransformFinalBlock(componentHash, 0, componentHash.Length);
        return BinaryPrimitives.ReadInt32LittleEndian(sha.Hash!.AsSpan(0, 4));
    }
}

// In Models/Support/ByteArrayComparer.cs
public sealed class ByteArrayComparer : IComparer<byte[]>
{
    public static readonly ByteArrayComparer Instance = new();
    public int Compare(byte[]? x, byte[]? y)
    {
        if (ReferenceEquals(x, y)) return 0;
        if (x is null) return -1;
        if (y is null) return 1;
        return x.AsSpan().SequenceCompareTo(y);
    }
}

// On RiskFunctionBase (v0.8; SystemComponent/FailureMode implement the same directly):
public byte[] CanonicalHash()
    => CanonicalContentHasher.Hash(ToXElement(), CanonicalizationRules.ModelRules);
```
