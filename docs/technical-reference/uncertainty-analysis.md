## 1. Why uncertainty matters

Risk estimates for dams and levees rest on limited data, expert judgment, and simplified models —
every input, from the flood-frequency curve to the response probabilities to the consequence
estimates, carries uncertainty. Unless that uncertainty is quantified and propagated, a decision
maker cannot say how confident to be in the results, whether risk exceeds tolerable guidelines at a
stated confidence level, or where additional data collection would reduce uncertainty most
effectively [26].

## 2. Two kinds of randomness

**Natural variability (aleatory).** The inherent randomness of the system — irreducible by further
study [38]. It is what the *input functions themselves* model: the flow-frequency curve's annual
maximum, the range of consequence outcomes across depths, durations, and warning times. The risk
integral integrates over natural variability to produce expected annual consequences.

**Knowledge uncertainty (epistemic).** The lack of knowledge about parameters and processes —
reducible with more data [37]. It is what the *uncertainty bounds around* the input functions
model: parameter uncertainty in the frequency distribution, elicited fragility uncertainty, warning
-time and evacuation-rate uncertainty in consequences. Its two primary sources are sampling
uncertainty (small effective record lengths) and model uncertainty (the chosen mathematical form
never fully explains the variable) [46].

The separation is structural: input functions carry natural variability; their uncertainty
distributions carry knowledge uncertainty. That clean split is what makes the two-loop simulation
possible.

## 3. Simulation options

**Mean risk only.** Risk is computed once from the expected value of every input function:

```
E[C] = f(NV, E[KU]).                                                              (1)
```

Fast, and sufficient when no confidence statement is needed. Formally it commutes the expectation
inside the risk integral (the TR's Eq. 94–95 independence assumption [7]) — legitimate for the
mean only when the integral is linear in the uncertain inputs. Where it is not, the mean-only
answer differs from the ensemble grand mean by a real, deterministic amount: the **Jensen gap**,
measured at ≈ 1.4% on the posterior-injection fixture in
[../verification/single-component-uncertainty.md](../verification/single-component-uncertainty.md)
(mean-only 55.543 versus ensemble grand mean 56.331). Neither number is wrong — they answer
different questions (§8, pitfall 5).

**Risk with full uncertainty.** The two-loop Monte Carlo propagates knowledge uncertainty through
the entire calculation, producing a distribution of every risk output. It is required when
confidence intervals are needed on the LEC, when risk is judged against tolerable-risk guidelines
at a confidence level, when sensitivity analysis must rank uncertainty drivers, and when the
standard deviation and tail risk must be estimated accurately.

## 4. The two-loop simulation framework

The outer loop samples knowledge uncertainty — for each realization i = 1…R, every input function
k of every component j samples a new curve `F*ᵢⱼₖ` from its uncertainty distribution at a
percentile rₖ. The inner loop computes risk with the sampled curves — the adaptive Gauss–Kronrod
integral per component and the VEGAS joint integral across components
([risk-integration.md](risk-integration.md)) — recording all five risk types and every configured
measure per failure mode, component, and system. Confidence intervals and the ensemble mean come
from the recorded realizations {θ*₁ … θ*_R}.

### 4.1 The v1.1 sampling design: a deterministic percentile matrix

The note's v1.0 machinery drew from a run-seeded subtractive PRNG during simulation. The v1.1
engine deliberately replaces that with a **deterministic, content-seeded percentile design**
generated before the realization loop ([hashing-and-seeding.md](hashing-and-seeding.md)):

- `SetupSamplers` gives each input function an N×D percentile matrix (N realizations × its own
  sampling dimensions), seeded from the component seed and the function's canonical content hash
  plus its sampler-walk ordinal. **No random number is generated inside the realization loop.**
- Same inputs + same seed → bit-identical results at any thread count; renaming, canvas moves, and
  reordering never change results — the content-based identity contract.
- `SamplingScheme` selects the design: `LatinHypercube` (the default) stratifies each function's
  percentile column, removing main-effect sampling variance; `MonteCarlo` preserves plain
  independent draws. On the deliberately linear discrimination scenario the replicate variance
  ratio measured 4.27×10⁴ in favor of LHS
  ([../verification/lhs-variance-reduction.md](../verification/lhs-variance-reduction.md)); on
  interaction-dominated models the benefit is smaller, since per-dimension stratification removes
  main-effect variance only.
- `PinnedSamplerSeeds` re-applies a captured seed map across model perturbations, removing seed
  noise from A/B comparisons while leaving quadrature adaptivity honest — a parameter effect then
  shifts results only within integration tolerance.

### 4.2 Integration discipline inside the loop

The mean pass, deterministic probes, and mean-only runs integrate at the tight production
tolerance; ensemble realizations integrate at the ensemble discipline (`EnsembleTolerance`,
default 1e-4) — a deliberate cost/accuracy split, since band statistics average across R
realizations while the mean pass stands alone. Tests comparing per-realization values against
exact quadrature pin the ensemble discipline explicitly.

### 4.3 Number of realizations

`Realizations` defaults to 1,000, which stabilizes means quickly (often within a few hundred
realizations); extreme percentiles (5th/95th) stabilize more slowly, so raise the count when tail
percentiles drive the decision [26]. The TR's App. C convergence formulas give the required N for
a target precision on a mean and on a percentile [7]. The v1.1 library imposes no file-format cap —
memory and runtime scale with R and are itemized before the run by the engine's resource estimate
— and `ConvergenceDiagnostics` reports the realization-adequacy indicators (SD/√N and confidence
half-widths on the headline scalars) with every ensemble run.

## 5. Sampling strategy by input-function family

All knowledge sampling is inverse-transform: a percentile r maps through the uncertainty
distribution's inverse CDF, `x = F⁻¹(r)` (Eq. 2). Per family:

- **Hazard functions.** Parametric hazards bootstrap their fitted distribution (or accept an
  externally fitted posterior through `Estimate(IList<ParameterSet>)` — the posterior-injection
  contract, sampled index-for-index), producing a new frequency curve per realization. Tabular
  hazards sample their per-ordinate uncertainty distributions co-monotonically along the curve;
  nonparametric hazards sample their derived log-quantile ladder. See
  [hazard-functions.md](hazard-functions.md).
- **Transform functions.** Tabular transforms sample per-ordinate uncertainty co-monotonically;
  the parametric transforms carry their fitted residual terms
  ([transform-functions.md](transform-functions.md)).
- **System response functions.** Parametric responses sample capacity-distribution parameters;
  tabular responses sample per-ordinate fragility uncertainty; event- and fault-tree responses
  sample each uncertain node source at its own content-seeded stream — sibling probabilities that
  sum above one normalize proportionally, exactly as in the deterministic algebra, and repeated
  link occurrences draw independent streams ([event-trees.md](event-trees.md),
  [fault-trees.md](fault-trees.md), [response-functions.md](response-functions.md)).
- **Consequence functions.** Tabular ordinates support deterministic, triangular, PERT, normal,
  log-normal, and truncated-normal uncertainty. Within a failure mode the failure and non-failure
  consequence functions sample **co-monotonically** (one percentile drives both), keeping the
  excess `C_Δ(x) = C_F(x) − C_NF(x)` consistent — both curves describe the same underlying
  scenario. The coupling is pinned, with a decoupled counter-pin proving the scenario
  discriminates, in
  [../verification/single-component-uncertainty.md](../verification/single-component-uncertainty.md).

Beyond the note's list, the composite families recurse — each child owns its dimensions and its
content-seeded stream — and a mixture's branch choice is **not** a knowledge dimension at all: the
engine enumerates exposure branches at every hazard level instead of drawing one
([composite-functions.md](composite-functions.md)).

## 6. Risk results with confidence intervals

**LEC bands.** Each realization constructs its exact loss-exceedance curve; the ensemble yields
percentile bands (e.g., the 90% band), the median, and the mean curve at each consequence level
([loss-exceedance-curves.md](loss-exceedance-curves.md)). Wide bands localize the hazard region
where knowledge uncertainty dominates.

**Conditional mean loss scatter.** Each realization contributes one (E[C|F], α) point; the R-point
cloud shows the joint spread of failure probability and conditional consequences — a tight cluster
is a robust estimate, a diffuse cloud a knowledge-limited one.

**Summary statistics.** Every configured risk measure is computed per realization;
`EnsembleSummary` reports the mean, standard deviation, and key percentiles of each measure's
distribution. Each measure reduces **independently** — percentile-consistent per measure,
deliberately not one coherent realization, because the 95th percentile of the value-at-risk is not
the value-at-risk of the 95th-percentile curve (the two orderings genuinely differ; see
[../verification/scalar-uncertainty.md](../verification/scalar-uncertainty.md)).

### 6.1 Weighted epistemic ensembles

The outer loop ordinarily treats its R realizations as equally credible: every band and summary
statistic gives each knowledge state weight 1/R. An optional per-realization weight vector
generalizes that — weight wᵢ states the **relative epistemic credibility** of realization i, and
every ensemble reduction becomes its weighted form:

- the mean of a measure is Σwᵢxᵢ/Σwᵢ;
- the percentile bands and summary percentiles use the symmetric weighted percentile — each
  positive-weight realization sits at plotting position p(i) = A(i)/(A(i) + B(i)) with A the
  weight strictly below and B strictly above, interpolating linearly between positions.
  Zero-weight realizations carry no mass (a refuted knowledge state drops out); equal weights
  reproduce the unweighted reduction;
- the convergence indicators report the weighted mean with standard error √(V/N_eff), where V is
  the reliability-weighted unbiased variance and N_eff = (Σw)²/Σw² is the Kish effective sample
  size — recorded on the summary as `EffectiveRealizationCount`, the honest statement of how many
  equally-weighted realizations the weighted ensemble is worth. A sharply concentrated weight
  vector means the ensemble carries less information than its raw count suggests, and the
  convergence check should be read against N_eff, not R.

Weights are **reliability (importance) weights**: only relative values carry meaning, they are
stored raw, and the reductions normalize internally. They are results-side state — never part of
a model's canonical hash and never an influence on sampling seeds, so a weighted run draws
bit-identically the realizations the unweighted run draws and only the reductions over them
change. Supplied as a run input (`RiskAnalysis.RealizationWeights`), weights shape the published
percentile bands and summary, are stamped into the stored ensemble, and are fingerprinted in the
run manifest; assigned to a finished result set (`EnsembleResults.SetRealizationWeights`), they
re-weight the scalar summary through `ComputeSummary` without re-simulation — the natural write
path for Bayesian likelihood re-weighting of an existing ensemble and for scenario or logic-tree
branch credibilities. The integrator effort diagnostics stay unweighted (they measure compute
actually spent), and a mean-only run refuses weights — there is no ensemble to weight.

### 6.2 Tolerable-risk confidence

The aleatory `ConsequenceThresholdProbability` measure asks about the loss distribution *within*
one realization; the guideline question is epistemic — **how confident are we that the risk
exceeds the tolerable threshold?** A `TolerableRiskCriterion` on the analysis options names a
scalar measure, a system stream, a consequence type, and a threshold (the default construction
is the annualized incremental-risk guideline shape: mean Excess risk of the primary type against
1e-3), and the full-uncertainty run reports

P(measure > threshold) = Σ wᵢ·1[xᵢ > c] / Σ wᵢ,

the realization-weight fraction whose measure strictly exceeds the threshold — weighted-aware
from birth, with the unweighted case the plain count fraction. Entries ride the ensemble summary
(`EnsembleSummary.TolerableRiskConfidence`, absent when no criteria are configured), echoing
each criterion so the statement is self-describing: "the probability that mean incremental life
loss exceeds 1e-3 is 0.12" is a direct confidence statement against the guideline, where the
percentile bands answer the inverse question (what risk a stated confidence level supports).
Criteria are compute-relevant analysis configuration — serialized and hashed only when
configured, never an influence on sampling seeds — and
`RiskAnalysis.ComputeTolerableRiskConfidence()` re-evaluates them over the stored ensemble
(including weights assigned after the run) without re-simulation. A mean-only run publishes no
ensemble summary and therefore no confidence block; validation warns when criteria are
configured on one.

### 6.3 Retained realizations and post-hoc re-banding

The percentile bands are assembled from the full per-realization curve sets, which are normally
released after the run — the stored ensemble keeps only the scalar summaries, which is exactly
why new weights re-reduce the *scalar* catalog but cannot re-draw the *curves*. Enabling
`RiskAnalysis.RetainRealizations` keeps the complete realization ensemble on
`RetainedRealizations` (runtime-only diagnostic state: never serialized, never hashed, no
influence on any computed value — the published results are byte-identical either way), and
`ReassemblePercentileBands(weights)` re-runs the weight-aware percentile assembly over the
retained state, returning fresh lower/upper/median/mean band realizations without touching the
published ones. Because weights never move a sampled realization, the post-hoc weighted re-band
is **exactly** the band set a run carrying those weights as its input would have published —
pinned byte-for-byte by test — completing the weighted-ensemble story: likelihood re-weighting
or scenario credibilities assigned after the run re-band the confidence curves with no
re-simulation. Validation warns while retention is on (the ensemble's full curve sets stay in
memory); a mean-only run has no ensemble and retains nothing.

A second, orthogonal selector exposes the integration ledger itself:
`RetainedIntegrationDetailIndex` (−1 for the mean-only pass, a realization index for the
ensemble) skips the selected realization's memory dump, so `RetainedIntegrationDetail` carries
every recorded `(hazard level, non-exceedance, mass, per-entry response probabilities,
per-entry consequences)` point on its component curves — the material to show how the integral
was built. Risk points never serialize, so the selection cannot move a stored byte.

### 6.4 Epistemic conditioning (fractile pinning)

`RiskAnalysis.FractilePins` holds a list of `FractilePin(functionId, percentile)` entries —
runtime-only, never serialized, never hashed — each holding one named function at a fixed
knowledge percentile while the rest of the ensemble varies. The result is a **conditional risk
statement**: "risk given the 95th-percentile hazard curve," the hazard-fractile ×
risk cross-tabulation a seismic or SSHAC-style review expects, and clean one-at-a-time holds.
A pin keys on `IRiskFunction.Id` — rename-proof and clone-stable — and is applied at sampler
setup by overwriting the target function's own pre-allocated percentile matrix **after**
seeding: every function's matrix is generated from its own dedicated stream, so no other
function's draws can move, and the captured sampler seed map is bit-identical to the unpinned
run (the seed-inertness contract, pinned at verification grade). Sweeping a pin over a fractile
grid recovers the unconditional ensemble as the weighted average of the conditioned runs — an
exact identity under median Latin hypercube sampling, where the unconditional draws are the
mid-bin grid the sweep visits.

Scope and reporting: pins reach the functions the component walk samples directly — the hazard,
stage transforms and responses, trailing and secondary-chain transforms, and profile
transforms. Validation errors on duplicate or unmatched ids and warns for pins with no effect —
a deterministic function, a function with no percentile surface (a posterior-indexed
parametric), or a consequence function, whose paired draws come from each mode's coupling
matrix (extending pins to the coupling columns is recorded future work). A referenced response
living only inside an event or fault tree's probability sources samples through the tree's own
setup clones and is refused loudly rather than silently not conditioned. The mean pass samples
the mean functions and is unaffected, so a mean-only run warns and ignores pins. A pinned
function's knowledge column is constant, and the reporting surfaces treat it honestly as inert:
the correlation sensitivity reports zero, the given-data measures report exactly zero for a
constant column, and the value-of-information estimator resolves exactly zero variance for it
(the constant-column convention — a bit-constant column short-circuits to zero rather than
reporting its arbitrary tie-order partition as a bins/n-scale noise floor).

## 7. Diagnostics

The library computes and serializes the diagnostic substance; plotting (kernel densities, tornado
charts, X-Y scatter, tabular explorers) is the consuming layer's presentation over the same
`EnsembleResults` JSON.

- **Integration diagnostics.** Per-realization integrator effort and reported error, aggregated in
  `ConvergenceDiagnostics` — the check that the inner loop converged across all realizations.
- **Risk-measure distributions.** The per-realization measure vectors behind `EnsembleSummary`
  give the full distribution of every measure, not just its mean.
- **Risk profiles.** Exceedance probabilities and conditional consequences against hazard level,
  filterable by component and risk type, with ensemble bands — the profile catalog on the results
  trees ([results-catalog.md](results-catalog.md)).
- **Sensitivity.** The engine ranks uncertainty drivers from the recorded realizations: Pearson
  and rank correlations between each sampled input stream and each risk output, and the squared
  correlation as the sensitivity index — for a single regressor exactly the regression variance
  share SIᵢ = (σ²_θᵢ/σ²_y)·βᵢ² of the note's Eqs. (3)–(4). Chance-node streams correlate
  positively with response probability, remainder streams negatively; a high index marks the input
  whose uncertainty reduction buys the most. The implemented surface
  (`MeasureSensitivity`, `MeasureSensitivityMatrix`, `HazardLevelSensitivity`) and its
  seed-rederivation contract are specified in
  [sensitivity-analysis.md](sensitivity-analysis.md); the tornado plot is the standard
  presentation of the ranked indices.

## 8. Practical guidance

Run full uncertainty whenever the decision is sensitive to confidence level: guideline comparisons
at a stated confidence, uncertainty-driver ranking, accurate σ and tail measures, and risk
communication that portrays the range rather than a point. The five pitfalls [26]:

1. **Running full uncertainty with no uncertainty defined.** Every realization is then identical
   and the bands collapse to a line — verify the key inputs carry uncertainty first.
2. **Under-specifying uncertainty.** Artificially tight bounds manufacture false confidence.
3. **Over-specifying uncertainty.** Arbitrary wide bounds drown the decision; the characterization
   must reflect the actual state of knowledge.
4. **Not checking convergence.** Tail percentiles from too few realizations mislead — confirm key
   statistics are stable against the `ConvergenceDiagnostics` indicators (or a doubled count).
5. **Confusing the ensemble mean with the "best estimate."** The ensemble grand mean incorporates
   knowledge uncertainty through a nonlinear integral and legitimately differs from the mean-only
   answer — the measured Jensen gap of §3. Report which one is being quoted.

Characterize uncertainty hardest where it matters most: the sensitivity ranking identifies the
inputs deserving the most careful elicitation or additional data.
