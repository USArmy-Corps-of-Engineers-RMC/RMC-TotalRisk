    /// equivalent-annual procedure) preserved exactly for positive rates: exactly n
    /// end-of-year terms with the base year discounted one full period (the year-b value
    /// carries (1 + r)^−1), a linear ramp from (baseYear, baseValue) to (futureYear,
    /// futureValue), then a plateau at the future value, and the capital recovery factor
    /// r(1 + r)ⁿ/((1 + r)ⁿ − 1) applied to the total present value. Two v1.0 behaviors are
    /// preserved deliberately and must be understood by callers: a future year beyond the
    /// end of the period silently truncates the ramp (the plateau is never reached and no
    /// diagnostic is raised), and a future year at or before the base year makes the whole
    /// stream the future value. A zero rate returns the exact limit — the plain average of
    /// the n year values — a documented deliberate improvement over v1.0, whose capital
    /// recovery factor evaluated an indeterminate form there; the same limit convention the

    /// the base year one full period over exactly n terms. This port anchors to the code —
