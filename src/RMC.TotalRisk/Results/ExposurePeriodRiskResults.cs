    /// A plain query result — never serialized — computed per realization from the stored annual
    /// measures and reduced with the stored realization weights. The period failure probability
    /// uses the binomial (independent annual trials) convention P_T = 1 − (1 − p)^T, exact for
    /// the engine's annualized failure probability; the Poisson rate form 1 − exp(−λT), which
    /// applies when the annual value is interpreted as a rate, agrees to a relative difference
    /// of approximately p·(T − 1)/2 — about 0.25% at an annual 10⁻⁴ over 50 years and shrinking
    /// proportionally below. The consequence conversions treat the selected stream's expected
    /// annual consequence m as a level annual amount: the cumulative expectation is T·m, the
    /// present value is m·(1 − (1 + r)^−T)/r at discount rate r (T·m at r = 0), and the
    /// equivalent annual value — the level annual amount whose present value matches — is the
    /// annuity round trip of that present value, which for a stationary analysis is m itself
    /// (the identity is deliberate; the year-interpolated base-versus-future composition lives
