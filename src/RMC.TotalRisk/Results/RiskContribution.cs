    /// normalized marginals, the common-cause adjusted marginals, the competing cumulative
    /// incidence functions, and the joint method's inclusion–exclusion pathways. Within each
    /// exclusive event, the event probability splits <i>equally</i> among the participating
    /// modes — exactly the Shapley value of the union game v(S) = P(∪ F<sub>j</sub>), since each
    /// exclusive event is a scaled dual-unanimity game — and the event's combined consequence
    /// splits <i>proportionally to the participants' marginal consequences</i> (equal split when
    /// they sum to zero, which also covers reliability mode). Shares always sum to the event's
    /// values, so Σ contributions ≡ the parent's recorded totals under every method, rule, and
    /// dependency; the one-mode events of the per-mode methods reduce the scheme exactly to
    /// "adjusted marginal × marginal consequence" — the decomposition other tools report.
